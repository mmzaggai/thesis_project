given up land for peace and gotten terror in return one thing that always surprises me when i read discussions about the israel arab palestinian conflict is how often people claim that israel is an aggressor colonizer or expansionist power but when you actually look at the history that narrative doesn t hold up take the sinai peninsula for example after the six day war israel controlled sinai a territory three times the size of israel itself if israel were truly a colonial power it could have easily held onto it instead in israel gave back the entire sinai to egypt as part of a peace agreement it dismantled settlements withdrew its army and even removed civilians living there because peace mattered more than holding land then there s gaza in israel made the painful decision to withdraw unilaterally from gaza it removed over jewish settlers and every single soldier hoping that the arab palestinians there would use the opportunity to build a functioning peaceful society instead hamas took over and within a year rocket fire into israeli cities began the result wasn t peace it was more war i always wonder if israel s goal is really occupation or ethnic cleansing why would it give back land even when it didn t have to no one forced israel to leave gaza no one forced it to give up sinai it did so in the name of peace and each time it was met with more violence not less so maybe the question isn t about land at all maybe the core issue is that one side has repeatedly shown they are willing to coexist compromise and make painful concessions and the other side has consistently rejected every offer from to today at some point isn t it worth asking who is actually preventing peace here', 'i m far more worried about islamism than i am about zionism because zionism even in its most extreme form with the whole greater israel thing doesn t want to conquer the entire world and make everyone jewish whereas islamism even in its most mild form requires everyone in the country to be muslim be a second class citizen if the person was never a muslim or dead if the person leaves the faith which is still a horrifying system of government i remember back in the s when every non muslim on earth including the ones who hate america and the west was unified on one position regardless of their stance on islam that isis is evil and needs to be destroyed fast forward to the s and we have a similar terrorist group just as savage called hamas which although they ve been around for a while they ve started gaining supporters worldwide all because their main goal is to destroy israel and replace it with a totalitarian theocratic palestine does that sound like a free palestine to you islamism is also a parasitic ideology that doesn t just affect the middle east but any country that leaves it untreated even if the government is secular this can be seen in islam s early days when mohammad conquered the middle east north africa and even parts of europe especially the iberian peninsula nowadays islamists prefer to spread their system of government via useful idiots who justify terrorist attacks and portray the terrorists as victims if left unchecked support for palestine could be a gateway to supporting hamas or worse lastly those islamist migrants who want to put sharia law into their new western country s government are ruining immigration to europe canada australia etc for people who want to live in those places who are also integrating and being a valuable asset to the country at least zionist immigrants don t want to turn their country jewish and force everyone to be jewish i hope you have a happy new year knowing all of this', 'you have very strong statements but without much foundation let s start with the assumptions from which you start your arguments first of all you defined the palestinians as the native people of palestine eretz israel this already shows your misunderstanding of the history of the place those arabs who now call themselves palestinians arrived in the area through islamic imperialist conquests and not by settling the place and creating a culture within it since an indigenous people is defined as being the first to inhabit and build a culture in a place like the native americans and natives like you in australia in addition the name palestine was given to the land by the romans after they conquered the area and suppressed the jewish rebellions against them so both the name you use for the place and the people you are talking about are the ones who acted in a colonialist manner and not the other way around in contrast after the canaanites whose culture was extinct the first people to build a culture in palestine which i will henceforth call the land of israel were the jewish people the israelites while the bible says that the israelites conquered the place historians estimate that the israelites were descendants of the canaanites but it doesn t matter which version is correct and which one you believe the point is that the jews were the first to create a religion culture and nation in that area which makes them native people the zionist movement and the jews who live in israel today are the only people who have the same culture currency language and religion in that land as it was about years ago i edited this part which makes israel and the zionist movement a decolonial movement one that returned the jewish people to the land of their origin as for the second assumption you made that the zionists killed and ethnically cleansed the palestinians most likely here you are talking about the nakba if you want to talk about another event or events i would be happy to but for now i will focus on this the jews in the land of israel were not the ones who started the nakba the nakba began according to the palestinians in and it only happened after the war of began with an arab palestinian attack on the jewish zionist settlement not the other way around the war continued and became a bigger war after israel s declaration of independence in when the arab countries decided to invade the newly founded israel some describe it as a series of wars while others consider it as one long war from consisting of parts during the war masses of arabs fled their homes and the battle zones into arab countries some of them left out of fear and some after the arab countries asked them to evacuate with the promise that they would win the war and bring them more territories as a gift this was the result of a war they started not deliberate ethnic cleansing before the war in under the british mandate or before that no jew took land belonging to an arab the lands they settled on they bought or they settled on land without ownership while they suffered pogroms by the arab residents don t get me wrong i m not here to argue with you or insult you i have a lot of respect for you and for the indigenous community of australia in general but i had to respond because defining zionism as a narcissistic psychopath movement is something i know stems from ignorance i d be happy to continue this discussion if you d like']"

from english control that makes no sense the british government would drop northern ireland like a hot potato if they got the chance we re nothing but a money drain and political headache it s the unionists who make up half of the population of northern ireland read not english who consider themselves british and oppose a united ireland all sides agreed to the good friday agreement which mandates for a referendum on a united ireland even nationalist politicians agree that it s too early for that the reason being is that it could reignite the troubles again the overwhelming majority of people in northern ireland are happy with the status quo especially those that have lived through the troubles myself included a united ireland is going to happen at some point but the protestant unionist population of the north need to feel part of it and that their views are taken on board that s why saying things like brits out or liberate ireland from england are counter productive and will actually slow down the process of a united ireland things aren t black and white and rhetoric doesn t help all sides in a conflict need to be listened to and respected that s how we got peace in the first place the peace process in northern ireland should be a model for the middle east', 'that s the simplified version let s go deeper we ll start with england s act of settlement of ireland whereas the parliament of england after the expense of much blood and treasure for suppression of the horrid rebellion in ireland have by the good hand of god upon their undertakings brought that affair to such an issue as that a total reducement and settlement of that nation may with god s blessing be speedily effected source ireland is the only european country that now has a population less than it had in the s our once estimated million plus population was by the early s reduced to million then due to various additional ethnic cleansing policies this already reduced figure was nearly halved by the time the majority of ireland broke free of foreign british colonial rule in at one stage in ireland s history of occupation the british state had stolen and gifted to strategically planted foreign british colonists four fifths of the land mass of ireland during these processes those native irish who escaped murder faced various ethnic cleansing policies forced to live on virtual wasteland hillsides and bogs forcibly transported to work to death on british empire plantations in foreign lands and or obliged to flee to other countries in coffin ships on which many perished throughout the s foreign british colonists were extensively planted across ireland s northern province of ulster their raison d etre was then and remains true to this day to aid and abet a foreign england s colonial state to suppress and dominate the most independent minded and resolutely freedom loving native irish of ulster in the british state passed the roman catholic relief act this relaxation of penal laws allowed the native irish nation to purchase land by enraged british colonists in ulster were alleging they were victims of ethnic cleansing due to the native irish being prepared to pay higher acreage prices in response british colonists such as armed sectarian murdering terrorists dan winters and james sloan et al formed the orange order terrorist group it began murderously perpetrating ethnic cleansing of those land purchasing native irish of the southern counties of ulster this terrorism is still regularly glorified and celebrated by the orange order in the british colonial parliament of westminster in england imposed partition of ireland with threats of immediate and terrible war thus was carved out of ireland s county province of ulster the undemocratic county northern ireland colony statelet with its artificial majority of british unionists colonialists during the s the new governing ulster unionist party and orange order orchestrated a series of fear instilling and inducement campaigns aimed at british colonialist protestants in the south they were encouraged to evacuate their families and move their sectarian businesses to help bolster and grow the new northern ireland statelet this campaign conjured images of dire retribution by the native irish in the south and of salvation in the form of offers of new homes and new jobs in the new ulster state during uup politicians and orangemen incited a new wave of pogroms against the native irish citizens of the new northern ireland statelet hundreds were murdered and thousands injured thousands had their homes and businesses destroyed and additional thousands were hounded out of their jobs by british colonialist mobs in british colonialist uvf terrorists subjected the native irish to a new wave of murders and firebombing of their businesses in a subsequent related court of appeal hearing in the court in belfast deemed this spate of attacks amounted to ethnic cleansing crimes th august during the clonard pogrom eight citizens were murdered hundreds were injured and fifteen hundred native irish citizens homes were destroyed these events ignited a thirty year conflict deeply felt by those of us who lived through those terrible times in british colonialist uda terrorists devised a doomsday plan to ethnic cleanse the ni colony statelet of its native irish population in response a prominent member of the democratic unionist party was reported as saying that this plan was a very valuable return to reality in british colonialist uda terrorists issued a new ethnic cleansing type warning that it had drawn an orange line around pro british protestant areas beyond which irish catholics would not be permitted ruaidr ua conchobair', 'why i changed from pro palestine to pro israel as an irish person please help correct anything i may have gotten wrong or missed out as an irish catholic all of my family and friends are pro palestine tbh i still wouldn t really say i am pro one side or the other as it is a complex conflict and not like choosing sides in a football match i feel sorry for innocent people on both sides however the more i learn the more i sympathise with the israeli perspective i honestly think that the pro palestine side is heavily reliant on buzzwords which sound good on social media posts or when chanted on the streets and twists a lot of the facts for example the way they frame the entire conflict is that of white settler colonist jews oppressing the poor indigenous brown people of palestine this resonates a lot with people in ireland who see it as equivalent to the long irish struggle for national independence against the british indeed people will point out that the british politician balfour is a key figure behind both the partition of palestine and the partition of ireland northern ireland i now believe this to be a false equivalence this is my current understanding it may be imperfect and please help correct me for a start the majority of jews in israel aren t white i think it s sad that this racial element is so important but apparently it is the middle eastern or mizrahi jews are the largest jewish group in israel they considerably outnumber the ashkenazi jews or jews of european descendent more importantly even the jews of european descendent ultimately trace their heritage back to the levant at the end of the day jews come from judea and arabs come from arabia this is an over simplification but it is true that jewish culture and ethnicity has been in the levant for at least years the jews were exiled from their homeland by the romans years ago the romans renamed the land palestine it is not an arabic word arab culture and religion came in the form of conquest after the invention of islam in the th century arab muslim conquerers built the al aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock over the ruins of the temple on the temple mount the holiest site in judaism by now arab islamic culture has been in the region for well over years so they should also be considered native since the beginning of their exile years ago jews have faced persecution wherever they went either as christ killers or as people who rejected the final prophet or later as racially impure however jews never fully left their homeland but remained a minority under centuries of colonial rule by the arab caliphates and later the ottoman empire despite what most people in ireland seem to think the modern state of israel was not created as a colony under british imperialism jewish settlers began returning to their ancestral homeland to escape persecution in europe from the late s onwards purchasing land from arabs and from absentee landowners in istanbul they came as refugees not conquerors at that time palestine was a backwater of the ottoman empire and its population was a faction of what it is today jewish settlers brought advanced agricultural and medical technology from europe and helped transform the land and enable it to support a larger population the jewish persecution ultimately culminated in the holocaust and the murder of million jews at which point the world agreed that the jews should have their own state the un decided to vote the state of israel into existence as part of a state solution in a vote from which britain actually abstained instead of accepting the democratic decision of the majority of the world s nations israel s bigger more powerful neighbours egypt jordan syria iraq decided to invade and try to wipe out the early state somehow israel managed to win this war but hundreds of thousands of palestines were displaced as a result my understanding is that many were told by the arab armies to flee during the war and promised they would be able to return home after the inevitable destruction of israel on the jewish side hundreds of thousands of jews in north africa and the middle east who had been there since the time of the roman exile were forced by the governments of those countries to leave for example before morocco had around jews and today it has less than iraq had jews but today less than talk about ethnic cleansing the majority of the jews of israel today are the descendants of these refugees mizrahi jews i believe so much death and suffering could have been avoided if the arab nations had accepted this partition plan since israel s arab muslim majority neighbouring countries invaded it more times days war yom kippur war etc and each time israel has won i believe a big factor in this is the effectiveness of military organisation in democratic states in contrast to authoritarian states since then dictators in authoritarian regimes in the middle east have had an incentive to keep the conflict alive in order to present themselves as champions of the palestinian cause and distract from internal human rights issues in their own regimes therefore neighbouring countries have continued to deny subsequent generations of palestinian refugees citizenship and equal rights however by israel was in the process of normalising relationships with the arab muslim states in peace negotiations facilitated by saudi arabia the greatest antagonist in the middle east today iran could not tolerate this so planned for its proxies hamas and hezbollah to launch attacks on israel beginning with the atrocities of oct th this is where i believe the ability of an irish person to understand the conflict breaks down completely if we consider the major groups of the palestinian resistance movement to be the plo palestinian liberation organisation and hamas i believe the average irish person can see reflections of the ira irish republican army in the plo they are non state actors willing to use violent means to achieve regional nationalistic goals a free and united irish state a free palestinian state tbh i think the plo are much more fanatical than the ira and harder to negotiate with in the s black september the plo tried to assassinate the king of jordan and started a civil war they got kicked out of jordan and moved to lebanon where they started a civil war that transformed the country from one of the most stable countries in the middle east to the lebanon of today in which a third of the country is ruled by a terrorist organisation times the plo were offered a state solution and everything they were asking for and each time they rejected it in the s the plo supported saddam hussein s genocidal persecution of the kurds in contrast in the s the ira disarmed and accepted a peace agreement that would see northern ireland remain part of the uk until such time as through democratic referendum the majority of the population chose to leave the uk and reunite with the republic of ireland unfortunately i believe the plo are still more reasonable actors than hamas who are not interested in regional nationalistic goals such as the creation of a palestinian state but follow a globalist ideology of jihad if i understand correctly hamas don t even believe in the concept of the nation state and believe that humans shouldn t be divided into different nationalities there should just be muslims and non muslims they seek to re establish the islamic caliphate the fanatical shia mullahs of tehran who train and fund hamas hezbollah and the houthis believe that global conflict is a prerequisite for the return of the mahdi and the end of the world this includes key events in modern day syria yemen and the return of the jews to the holyland specifically jerusalem from an irish perspective concerned with regional nationalistic struggle it is almost impossible to empathise with this point of view or how organisations could seriously base their geopolitical strategy on such eschatological nonsense for this reason irish people are completely blind to this aspect of the conflict but this is exactly what hamas and hezbollah believe and why they can t be negotiated with they live in a different reality in which life in the secular world is unimportant compared to the eternal hereafter hamas leaders have even declared that they love death as much as the jews and americans love life the ira as bad as they might have been were motivated by nationalism not religious fanaticism and would never have engaged in the kind of violence against women and children that was undertaken by hamas on oct th many irish people unfortunately see that day as an uprising similar to the easter rising of irish rebels against the british government in ireland in they can t see the conflict as anything but a nationalistic struggle against colonial oppression because how could anyone seriously believe in that kind of religious end of the world religious nonsense and this is what leads irish people to view the conflict through the lens of the other key buzzwords genocide and apartheid state after all the actions of the british government continuing to export food from ireland during the potato famine were arguably genocidal and catholics remained second class citizens in the apartheid state in ireland created by the protestant ascendancy of the th century never mind that almost of israel citizens are arab muslim some of which are lawyers doctors members of the supreme court i believe that arab muslims in israel have more rights and a higher quality of life than arab muslims in almost any other country in the middle east the benefits of living in a liberal democracy as opposed to living under a dictatorship or theocracy and from what i understand the road signs are in hebrew arabic and english which would be a very unusual step for an apartheid state to take it might not be surprising therefore that there are thousands of arab muslim israelis in the idf as well as other religious and ethnic minorities such as christians and druze who know how much better their lives are under a democratic government than they would be under an authoritarian or islamic government like hamas i don t know how they expect us to believe that an army is committing genocide against a specific ethnic group when that army itself has thousands of soldiers from that same ethnic group there were zero bosniak muslim soldiers in the serbian army in the actual genocide in bosnia in the s the numbers also don t add up million people in gaza dead half of which are hamas terrorists the death of a single innocent civilian is heartbreaking but it is a tragically unavoidable part of war i believe many on the pro palestine side are naive regarding the difference between war and genocide the absolute number seems low for a genocide compared to other ongoing conflicts in the region dead in syria dead in yemen also the combatant civilian death ratio or maybe whereas a typical modern urban war involves more like or civilian deaths for every combatant the fact that so many people are fixated on the number of dead is also unusual i think and not typical of any previous conflicts i truly believe that if social media and smartphones had existed during ww many supporters of the pro palestinian movement would have been posting videos on tiktok of german children being pulled from the rubble and saying we have to have a ceasefire now too many german civilians have been killed the allies are clearly evil let s give the nazis time to regain their strength and build up their technology but we just have to have a ceasefire now one side is completely based on buzzwords street protests and social media influencers the depressing part is that no one has the time to look into the history or geopolitical and religious nuances of the conflict it s so much easier to watch a short tiktok video with emotional background music or shout buzzwords in a street protest the likelihood i will be able to convince any of my friends or family to re evaluate the nuances of the conflict are so close to zero as to basically not be worth attempting']"

socialism as we can see from cases where it was implemented ignores loads of other issues for the sake of the ideology the reasons why so few people would actually want yugoslavia back is because during it people were forced to abandon religion and national identity which was so strong before it that we were on opposing sides when hitler invaded when austrians fought the turks and in so many other cases similar things happened in the eastern bloc and in all other attempts where multiple ethnicities and groups were forced to live under the rule of one party and coincidentally every single case that is mentioned above so while it s completely possible that people percieve that the economic situation were better at the time which is more than questionable in many cases especially romania hungary and east germany its not the only measure of the success of socialism as you claim it to be im not saying that all socialist policies are bad some are quite good in fact but im just saying that the way that it was implemented in europe made people hate it for reasons other than economic policy', 'i take no offence to you asking more questions just to be clear talking about this with people is a passion of mine even if our ideas eventually diverge first let me preface this by saying that marxism in some respects is considered a science relative to other political ideologies it doesn t intend to appropriate ideas into our political reality rather it observes our political reality to which certain conclusions can be made for one s self given the expansive scope of marxism as a science you ll only get the spark notes from reading the manifesto with that being said let me start with the more fundamental components of marxism which is contradiction and particularly class contradiction the most basic example is that capitalists would like you to work as much as possible for the smallest amount of pay whereas workers would like to work as little as possible for the most amount of pay this is a contradiction because there is no world where this can be entirely resolved in other cases this dialectic the merging of two contradictions manifests in other areas of life now i m not going to get into the weeds on this but essentially capitalism requires unlimited growth to sustain itself this is because of the process of loaning speculation and often diminishing rates of profit over time in order to sustain this the scales of class contradiction shift in order to maintain growth this includes not raising wages relative to productivity inflating prices committing conquest to extract resources from other countries etc you mentioned the constitution and what you re witnessing is that civil rights have been infringed upon in order to sustain this growth as in the government who is owned by capitalists is telling you to bend over and take it for an example relevant to this sub both democrats and republicans have attempted to silence dissent against israel because its location in the middle east is crucial to its economic strategy based on controlling trade routes and exerting influence over states that control a considerable amount of the global oil supply capitalists cannot accept that israel is committing genocide without compromising this strategy therefore they opt to silence the people to continue growth now it might appear that ive detracted a bit but on the topic of what to do but it leads directly to this point if we observe where communism has naturally formed globally the people of these nations have experienced the worst of this contradiction russia had mass starvation and state repression prior to the soviet union china s government ignored their peasantry while they were being raped and slaughtered by japanese imperialists vietnam suffered as a result of french imperialism cuba had damn near slave plantations the list goes on so its a tough pill to swallow but naturally society will no longer be able to withstand this oppression and will eventually take arms for a revolution just as they did in all other nations it wont be because socialism or communism is a greater ideal but rather it ll be a means of survival looking to america you have the wealthiest nation that simultaneously has a massivedrug epidemic deep poverty homelessness etc this is a direct byproduct of this contradiction so if you want to do anything at all you should organize this is something that you ll hear often amongst communists and the reason is moreso related to preparing for the inevitable as opposed to doing something immediately but america is in the middle of collapse so these contradictions are becoming more and more apparent i know it sounds prophetic and that was something that was initially challenging for me but i ve only talked about of what marxism speaks on and if you become more familiar with its theory you ll realize how applicable it all is to our reality one funny example is that marx to some degree was able to predict cryptocurrencies centuries ago simply by understanding the dynamics that are inherent to capitalism lenin also greatly contributed to the thought with more contemporary applicability i m not going to convince you by typing out this comment on my phone so i implore you to simply start out by seeking some of this information out by yourself but hopefully ive at least offered some early insight', 'russia so as soon as putin became president of russia the poll reached from to the country famous for lies deceit assassination attempts on opposing political figures missing reporters courtless jailed people raised retirement age so people will work more and so on you are saying that the person who controls like a dictator over his people doesn t have the power to simply lie or threaten the voters don t get me started on the countless rig accusations hungary intentionally misinterpreted didn t say communism was better but that are worse economical now which in a collapsed regime will alway happen agreed to the switch from communism to capitalism while didn t east germans as the article says the overwhelming majority of the people voted were extremely young when the regime collapsed they had no perception of whether or not it was better even the guy they are interviewing said that he was when the wall went down and of course childhood memories are the best besides the berlin wall is an absolute symbol around the world that you cannot decide families for the sake of ideology romania are you kidding me ceausescu was a ruthless dictator who starved regions of romania to death and gunned down civilians without hesitation he was literally overthrown and you are saying that this outdated article shows that romanians prefer communism every romanian will tell you of the horrors ceausescu did the only reason to why there might be people who praise ceausescu is because he was extremely good at hiding his crimes because to be honest he did industrialise the country and installed good methods of transport serbia quote from the article by saying that life was better in socialism than it is now the serbian citizens primarily refer to better economic situation and standard of living but the majority of them would not go back to that period bulgaria st it s they lived better not prefer nd same thing as east germany where nostalgia plays an unnecessary role in all of this rd the polls are outdated and th i live here and let me tell you a communist is very rare to find the socialist party is co stantly at rd and th place when elections happen conclusion you are warping the truth just like your faithful comrades did for over half a century if you want freedom for palestine communism isn t going to get it for you and you will end up in a prison of lies deceit hunger death oppression and all of those lead to anger which leads to chaos also the fact that every post communist country hasn

year intelligence gathering and covert operations inside iran developing capabilities and conducting covert operations that could have led to the success of operation rising lion the operation used commando teams precision weapons and explosive drones on iranian soil while eliminating nuclear scientists and security officials now more details about the operation have emerged than ever before as current and former israeli intelligence officials described commando raids and undisclosed targets in interviews with propublica describing the country s decades long secret operation to prevent iran from building a nuclear bomb they requested anonymity in order to speak freely commando teams in iran the mossad recruited and trained two commando units each had teams of four to six members some of them were already in iran having received months of regular training from iranian intelligence agents others were refugees from the country s regime who had slipped into the country the day before for months mossad agents had been keeping an eye on the radar and missile batteries protecting iran s enrichment facilities and just before the attack they were also doing key things from hacking into iranian computers to jamming early warning radars israeli trained commando teams recruited from across the country from iran and neighboring countries were preparing to attack iran s defenses from within mossad commando units operated throughout central iran and were positioned in strategic open areas near iranian anti aircraft missile systems the commandos were old fashioned in the june airstrikes officials interviewed by propublica said as it is impossible for the israeli air force to go from wave to wave without losing a single aircraft according to intelligence gathered by mossad agents in the country israeli warplanes bombed nuclear facilities destroyed about of iran s ballistic missiles and of its launch vehicles and fired missiles into the rooms of iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders mossad s secret drone base in iran one unique feature of operation rising lion was that the mossad established an explosive drone base deep inside iran near tehran mossad apparently even set up a factory on the main road to manufacture drones and smuggled in parts for assembly in addition to smaller ready made drones in suitcases trucks and shipping containers the goods were stored in safe houses and later among other places to the drone base in some cases several transactions were made with partners who were unaware of the cargo being transported mossad agents inside iran then collected the equipment and distributed it to teams that prepared the drones for use the team leaders were trained at iran s request and they then returned to transfer the skills to teams on the ground the drones were activated during the n to be used not only to launch the drones themselves but also from smuggled and re equipped mobile platforms that were used to destroy iranian surface to surface missile launchers including the esdaf near tehran these systems destroyed iranian air defenses and gave israeli aircraft air superiority and freedom of action at iran s request in a separate operation the mossad secretly installed attack and advanced technology on vehicles to neutralize iran s air defense capabilities these systems were also activated at the onset of surprise precision strikes on leaders and nuclear scientists with the hezbollah pager operation israeli spies exploited their ability to hack into iranian communications systems in the early stages of the operation israeli cyberwarriors sent a fake message to iranian military leaders luring them to a ghostly underground bunker which was then destroyed in a precision strike twenty were killed according to three chiefs of staff the mossad compiled general information on the habits and whereabouts of iranian nuclear scientists the files even mapped the locations of the rooms in the men s homes on the morning of june israeli air force aircraft fired air to ground missiles at all coordinates killing participants mossad had been planning the final attack on iran s nuclear program for over a year but had been operating in the country for years before that recall that in israeli trained operatives broke into an unguarded tehran warehouse using plasma cutters to break open safes containing blueprints data computer disks and design books the material weighing about kg was loaded onto two trucks and driven to neighboring azerbaijan israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu presented the material at a press conference in tel aviv proving that iran had lied about its nuclear weapons intentions two years later mossad killed one of iran s top physicists by using ai enhanced facial recognition to control a remote controlled machine gun parked on the side of the road near his weekend home local actors role emphasized in operation rising lion all strikes inside iran were carried out solely by local agents and without the entry of israeli fighters into iranian territory this reflects a fundamental shift in mossad s approach that began about years ago previously mossad operatives likely israelis posing as europeans to install or maintain equipment wandered around natanz in double soled shoes to collect dust and soil samples tests eventually revealed that iranian made centrifuges were enriching uranium well above the percent level required for a nuclear power plant medical isotopes use percent enriched uranium bombs use percent now the iranian mossad agents who broke into safes planted machine guns blew up air defenses and monitored scientists apartments were not israelis all were either iranian or third country nationals according to officials interviewed by propublica the growing unpopularity of the iranian regime has made it much easier to attract agents in addition about percent of iran s million people are ethnic minorities arabs azeris baluchis kurds and others the motives of mossad s local agents were a mix of personal and political some wanted revenge against the oppressive theocratic regime while others were attracted by money

conclusion is that mossad s changed approach relying on local actors could also play a major role in the future as iran continues to implement its nuclear weapons program and israel prevents its

drug in facilities run by the israeli healthcare system in israeli authorities issued a directive to healthcare provided against administering the drug without full patient consent and knowledge a knesset study found a drop in birth rate between among ethiopian jewish women and according to other studies of the women who were being given depo provera in israel were ethiopian which are of the total population israel has never admitted that there was a systematic planned effort to reduce the ethiopian birth rate but given what happened it s not unreasonable to think there was some degree of intent', 'israel sterilizing ethiopian jewish refugees and the depo provera affair these claims are resurfacing on reddit so i thought it d be useful to share some context the story concerns approximately ethiopian jews also known as beta israel who immigrated to israel between and during the ethiopian civil war most of them passed through refugee camps set up in sudan or ethiopia which were not run by israel although the american jewish joint distribution committee jdc provided material support in these camps hundreds of ethiopian jewish females were administered depo provera an injectable contraceptive that lasts about weeks its use by itself is not controversial as it is part of the standard toolkit supplied by the un refugee agency unhcr worldwide particularly in areas with high sexual violence and infant mortality it is also one of the most popular forms of birth control in sub saharan africa due to its low cost and relative safety after the refugees arrived to israel israeli doctors reviewed their medical records asked if they wanted to continue with the injections and gave them another however in israeli journalist gal gabai discovered that some women did not understand that depo provera prevents pregnancy and its potential side effects while much of it was due to language barriers it is also possible that some women in refugee camps were brow beaten into taking the contraceptive several women were told that they had to receive the shots if they wanted to immigrate to israel in one covert recording a nurse was heard saying that the shot is given primarily to ethiopian women because they forget they don t understand and it s hard to explain to them additional evidence includes a letter sent by the israeli government to the director of the jdc medical programs in ethiopia praising his work noting that of his patients use a form of birth control compared with of ethiopians this revelation triggered a scandal followed by an investigation by the israeli state controller a official report found no evidence that the shots were administered under pressure or threats over or covert but recommended that the doctors refrain from giving the injections unless they were absolutely certain that the patients were giving informed consent tebeka the ethiopian legal aid group that took the story to court agreed that israel did not have a deliberate policy to reduce birth rate among ethiopian women specifically but noted that underlying racist sentiment allowed the matter to perpetuate unchecked today the number of ethiopian jews in israel more than doubled to their fertility rate dropped from children per woman in to in it remains unclear whether the depo provera affair contributed to the decrease but a study in the international journal of ethiopian studies conclued that the rapid decline in fertility rates among ethiopian israeli women following their migration to israel was not the result of the administration of depo provera but rather the product of urbanization improved educational opportunities a later age of marriage and commencement of childbirth and an earlier age of cessation of childbearing', 'mythbusters sterilization of ethiopian jews a point repeatedly brought up while discussing racism or apartheid in israel is the forced sterilization of ethiopian jewish women newspapers have reported it slightly less reputable newspapers have reported it and like everything it eventually found its way to reddit comparisons have been made to human experimentation in the shoah and where the shoah is mentioned can articles like this be far behind so what are the facts were they sterilized planned birth control broadly falls into these categories natural birth control pulling out not having sex during ovulational etc oral contraceptives popularly called birth control pills long acting reversible contraception including implants devices injections etc sterilization vasectomies for men tubal ligation salpingectomy and hysterectomy absolutely not recommended for women as you can see only the fourth point is called sterilization the only permanent method of birth control the rest are temporary methods of birth control including the injections used in our case depo provera it is sometimes called a depo shot or simply birth control shot depo provera has almost no long lasting effects it need to be renewed every weeks to be effective and if there are any lingering side effects they go away within a year of stopping the injections no matter how long you have taken depo provera you will be able to conceive if you go off the shot provided you would have been able to conceive without it in the first place ergo no long lasting side effects this was observed even in our case where ethipian women who went off the shot could conceive without problems x b why were they given any kind of birth control ethiopian jews came to israel from either transit camps without going into details transit camps are like temporary refugee camps and refugee camps have a pressing need for birth control this is for many reasons most refugee camps are overflowing and cannot handle increased populations maternal mortality rates are high so are mortality rates associated with abortions gynecologists on the other hand are in short supply sexual violence is high postpartum care is mostly unavailable the overwhelming need for birth control in refugee camps is best summed up by this article at refugee camps birth control is crucial and in short supply quartz qz com without birth control refugee camps find it almost impossible to function and there are times when healthcare providers in refugee camps ask for birth control to take priority over other medications x b are women forced or threatened to take them no there are little to no refugee camps where contraception sterilization birth control is forced a report into this by israel suggests that no such threats were made are they browbeaten into taking them almost certainly we can discuss the ethical implications of a woman s body and her choice and i welcome that discussion but we must keep in mind that in the case of refugee camps doctors are fighting a very real threat of high maternal and infant mortality there just aren t enough people to provide women the care they need and this is a good temporary preventive measure another advantage of injections like depo provera is light to no mensuration which is great because refugee women also don t have access to pads tampons cups which leads to higher infections sexual violence is also a big problem due to increased need to use the mostly non gender segregated toilets in most cases women are informed of what they are taking but there are language barriers that sometimes causes this information to be lost in translation i have worked as a surgeon in a lot of refugee camps so this is anecdotal but we were asked to communicate to every patient that birth control was available to them and could have benefits for them quite a few female patients had tried to either self administer or participate in an unsafe abortion which led to bleeding infections etc and we always insisted on birth control for them and i am not even a gynecologist did israel browbeat them transit camps for ethiopian refugees in sudan were not run by israel even in later operations most transit camps were administered by local officials american jewish joint distribution committee did play a role in them but not the israeli government a report commissioned by the government in found as such x b but why aren t men good question it s because of sexual violence giving women birth control means they are less likely to get pregnant than giving their husbands vasectomies and hoping they don t get raped but why don t they give them daily medication like pills it is true that pills are the most common form of birth control and it is certainly true for israel this leads to mistaken headlines like depo provera is only given to ethiopian jews or it is a means of last resort in some ways that is true but not in refugee camps because daily birth control is expensive depo provera turns out to be the cheapest means of reliable temporary birth control and thus this is what gets shipped to refugee camps it s use is overwhelmingly prevalent in refugee camps also while less talked about a lot of women hawk their daily birth control medication to get money for other things they also become target of thefts x b but why are we talking about refugee camps they live in israel true but one thing transit camps are surprisingly good at keeping are medical records so when these women arrived in israel the physicians just looked at the chart asked if they wanted to continue the medication and gave them another injection it is not standard procedure to explain what the injections do at each administration so the women who did not know about the injections never found out and those who were pushed into it never got a second opinion so the practice of taking depo provera mostly continued unimpeded which led to a marked decrease in childbirths among ethiopian women ok but they could stop it once they found out and they did the new recommendation is to not renew the injection automatically but to administer it as if it were the first time as in to explain what it does it s side effects it s long term use etc before recommending it money for birth control isn t a problem in israel so a lot of women opt for birth control pills because they give you more flexibility as you can get pregnant almost immediately after you stop taking it but why only black women because in the recent years only ethiopian women came as refugees to israel and while many bnei manasseh jews have made it to israel they come from a relatively stable country and definitely not from refugee camps though india had it s own problems with sterilization a common accusation thrown around in this case is laughable false because israel explicitly worked to import these jews to the country mossad launched operations for it large scale airlifts were planned and executed the law of return does not actually require such operations israel could have weaponized bureaucracy to make sure they never made it to israel but that is not what happened']"

its not really that odd you wanna try and say their is no genetic testing because they don t allow rd parties to operate genetic testing in the country is a bit of a stretch not to mention sometimes

law doesn t prohibit dna tests outright but imposes strict regulations especially on tests that determine familial relationships for example paternity tests in israel can only be conducted with a court order a genetic test for family ties will not be conducted except by order of a family court the law states we translated it from hebrew this is part of a broader framework designed to protect individuals from having their genetic information used without proper oversight further confirmation that genetic testing is not outright illegal in israel but regulated for specific medical and

no one gives a f and on saturday s many stores that are open are usually staffed only by arabs is there discrimination probably just like how there is in literally every country in the world but to call it apartheid is a slap in the face to people who actually faced apartheid pre zionist palestine had everyone living peacefully try the riots in hebron and tzfat the jerusalem pogroms the jaffa riots the hebron massacre wasn t very peaceful it s a white european colony there are israeli jews that come from about countries most of which are not in europe many israeli jews may have white

illegal but it is heavily restricted for example paternity testing requires a court order and using dna to prove jewish heritage for immigration purposes is contentious and not accepted by default the illegal claim is exaggerated but there are real issues around the state regulating identity through genetics countries agreed this is a tired antisemitic trope but it s not central to any valid pro palestinian position no one credible is using this to critique israel s current actions beheaded babies this was reported and repeated widely including by israeli spokespeople early on like idf rep

t erase that pre zionist palestine no one serious is saying it was a utopia but colonial projects often justify themselves by exaggerating historical tensions and violence the key point is that palestinian displacement wasn t inevitable and the nakba didn t happen because of riots it happened because of a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing in white european colony israel s jewish population is diverse true but the power structures remain heavily ashkenazi dominated and early zionism was rooted in european settler colonial thinking you don t have to be white to participate in or benefit from colonialism epstein jfk fringe conspiracy nonsense agreed but don t pretend every pro palestinian voice is pushing that if your filter for criticism is someone said something dumb on

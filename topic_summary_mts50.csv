but you re not going to convince literally anyone else the world can see through your efforts to dehumanize a group of occupied people who have basically no means of fighting back as a way of trying to legitimize your extermination of them i hope that most israelis see things more clearly than you but if what you re saying is indicative of how most israelis feel the world will come to see israel as a genocidal stain on history a st century force of evil against which all other acts of evil are measured from here on out history and the world will turn its back on you because in general most countries have agreed that it s no longer fair to occupy a group of people and especially not exterminate them because you are failing to distinguish between people and their government your argument that people are choosing to be palestinian is absurd so this is the last time i ll entertain it palestinians cannot just become arab israelis there is a cap on minority citizenship in israel and gazans actually physically cannot enter israel they also cannot simply immigrate to syria jordan lebanon or egypt for reasons i mention above and even if they could it s unfair to expect them to leave where exactly are you arguing that someone born in gaza should go how would you like them to get there please be for real your objection to an entire nationality is based on the assumption that it is synonymous with a death cult but where did you get this information you didn t respond to my point about polling which shows basically nobody wanting to actually eliminate israel or israelis recent polling shows that palestinians want one of three things the two state solution based on the borders the solution of a confederation between the two states of palestine and israel and a one state solution in which the jews and palestinians live with equality the biggest support went to the two state solution slightly less than half followed by the confederation and the one state solution when it came to ways to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state out of supported armed struggle one third supported negotiations and one fifth supported popular peaceful resistance polling of israelis is not quite so generous and actually seems to indicate that they might be the ones living in a death cult of israelis do in fact want to exterminate palestinians by expelling them from the land you included it seems this is so outside the bounds of what i consider normal human moral reasoning but then i remember that jewish israelis and palestinians live in physically segregated realities and israeli society has become much more extremist ethnonationalist and expansionist since the likud party began to reshape israeli society in which has only intensified under netanyahu and which has reached new heights since october today the vast majority of israelis hold views that feel outrageous to people like me who were raised in a multiethnic liberal democracy the united states in other words you might be in the one in a death cult shall i make the same argument that you re making that israelis have been brainwashed into an exterminationist ideology and therefore should all have to leave', 'your argument is based on is the presumption that all palestinians know which palestinians are hamas and which aren t and therefore can make a conscious choice to help them or not based on the motivations you have ascribed you go further to assume that palestinians must be with them if they re not vocally against them i m just going to say that s a ridiculous notion do you think members of the ira fln red army faction mukti bahini french resistance or viet cong wandered around town announcing to everyone who they were when doing their groceries no of course they didn t they tried to keep their identities relatively hidden so they could go about the business of militancy do you think hamas is stupid enough to have believed that before the war and currently israel didn t have some kind of intelligence gathering operation going on in gaza they will obviously have taken some kind of step to hide their identity so let s say you re a palestinian year old and some guys who just moved into your apartment building ask you to help load some boxes into their car you don t know the boxes are full of aks but you want to be a good neighbour so you help them you have no idea these people are hamas are you a complicit terrorist in fact let s take that further the guys have moved into your apartment building except now you know they re hamas now you are aware that there s some violent guys with aks living on your doorstep and they re asking you to help load some boxes you just want to go to school and play fifa in peace so you help them with the boxes to get it over with and go about your business because you don t want any trouble are you now a complicit terrorist let s take that even further same neighbours but this time you actually actively hate hamas you know they re hamas you know they re violent they ask for help with the boxes you ve got your mom and sister to look after what now endanger your family or help with the boxes are you a complicit terrorist one more for good measure same as the last one but this time they ask you to keep a box because they re running out of space what do you do are you going to shoot them your mom and sister are going to get murdered in that case are you a complicit terrorist the fact of the matter is the dynamics of aiding and abetting hamas are so much more complex than being pro or against and it s the gross simplification of these dynamics that s being used to justify the wholesale slaughter of people that often don t have any other choice because half the time they re being lied to or coerced seriously if you don t like hamas what are you going to do defect to israel don t get me wrong i m sure there are some pro hamas true believers around but most of the population weren t even around or were small children when they got into power in the first place and then we have these small children who may be knowingly and willingly helping hamas do you think they re in possession of all their faculties or do you think they re being taken advantage of like all other child soldiers in the world and if they aren t why is your side not actively putting your ire and activism toward their captors hamas my ire and activism is against hamas i freely speak out against hamas but the reality is that hamas doesn t have widespread international support from western governments and it s already understood that most reasonable people don t endorse the rape and pillage of innocents in opposition israel is slaughtering an astonishing number of innocents and blatantly trying to hide something why is international press not allowed to enter the conflict zone like they have been in conflicts like ukraine iraq afghanistan nagorno karabakh etc it s obvious to any observer that the civilians are being slaughtered either through willful intent to harm or callous indifference as we speak my country and my taxpayer money is supporting this your turn to answer the question i posed in the op let s get this discussion back on track', 'i really don t think we re gonna get anywhere with this and if the unhcr considers descendants refugees they don t have that definition on their website which makes it confusing also unrwa states that palestinian descendant refugees in their website are only those who are descendant from a father not a mother which makes their definition even more confusing regarding outpost that israel says itself are illegal having government support any links would help i m not saying a two state solution isn t a possibility you are don t put words into my mouth isreal could withdraw settlers and keep a military presence there but due to the shear number of people that s never going to be politically likely or easy to do even if implemented i just pointed out that the last experience of removing settlements from gaza resulted in hamas taking power and them firing rockets from said area into israel due to said experience it makes it unlikely for israel to remove settlements though a military occupation with removal of settlers could be done but there s the risk that could be even worse because an increase of military on the border could create more of a target and interactions with the idf could be more violent than those between settlers and west bank palestinians resulting in more violence kinda like how northern ireland doesn t have a hard border as it would become a target for attacks and could risk violence starting again first you have to get israel to get rid of its settlements i don t know how it was negotiated for getting rid of settlements in gaza but i d assume that some sort of payment to get settlers a way to get homes back in israel would be needed and politically whatever politician is doing so will need some incredibly strong assurances from the plo like ending the martyr payments or making sure no terrorist attacks are made but sadly i doubt the plo wouldn t be able to keep that last promise the hard part is that if israel gets rid of the settlements what can they gain from doing so because if a politician does that they will have tons of backlash and a far right wing politician will use that and put the settlements back unless there s something the politician can point to as a win for israel getting rid of settlements they likely won t have political capital for the future and further negotiations as the plo had massive corruption and other failures i doubt they could control the new area effectively and the minute attacks happen from the area israel will retaliate extremely harsh and it will reinforce the idea they need settlements for defense we have seen a military occupation of the west bank by jordan for years so we have an example to go off of unlike any other arab country to which they fled after the arab israeli war palestinian refugees in the west bank and on the east bank were given jordanian citizenship on the same basis as existing residents but this created problems as it was seen as part of jordan s expansionist policy and in response saudi arabia lebanon and syria joined egypt in demanding jordan s expulsion from the arab league it resulted in palestinian guerrillas and israeli commandos crossing the green line even with jordan in control of the area also jordan having a military force in the area is different than israel and i think would have less confrontation between the two abdullah i of jordan who had become emir of transjordan in and king in was assassinated in july during a visit to the jami al aqsa on the temple mount in east jerusalem by a palestinian gunman following rumours that he was discussing a peace treaty with israel so i think that unless the pa has the authority and control to assure that there won t be any attacks across the border when those settlements are gone i don t know my best bet is that israel focuses on its housing as economics are part of why people go to settlements as it s cheaper if they pay in a way where settlers who are there for economic reasons have homes in israel proper than they might leave those for religious reasons would be less easy and a slow migration over time is the only way it would work any rushed one would not succeed and be chaos then maybe have jordan provide a military defense or temporary control over the border area for israel s protection because if israel does a military occupation replacing settlers with israeli troops there will likely be attacks and chaos i think jordan would be more likely to be an easier transition and since many jordan people are palestinian they would likely have less confrontation with palestinians in the west bank but there is a risk that some more extreme palestinian groups would see this as weakness and pushing israel back and that they could ask for more and maybe think they could get rid of all of israel but yeah my solution is an economic plan for former settlers both parties controlling their more extreme people and jordan as a security force in the meantime']"
0,1518,0_land_the_jews_of,"['land', 'the', 'jews', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'was', 'the land', 'in', 'were']","['i m genuinely trying to understand what you mean when you say you find it offensive to hear that palestinians came from arabia and colonized this land what i said here was a response to the title of this post i m just poking fun at it i don t get offended by it if anything it s quite understandable to think so i m just saying it s false i m jewish around generations rooted in this land my family lived here for centuries side by side with arabs and l ve never denied their presence but the historical record is pretty clear arab presence in this region began with a seventh century conquest the modern palestinian identity as a distinct national group only formed in the twentieth century especially after the s with the creation of the plo and became more politically solidified in the s i think i made it clear in the comment i linked that not all arabs are the same arab is a really broad term sudanese arabs and syrian arabs are not the same yes the arab conquest happened in the th century but there is a difference between arab arabized and semi arabs palestinians are ancestors of the cannites and it s well known and i ve linked proof with my original comment although it s true a good percentage of modern palestinian identity was formed in the s but it s mainly them abandoning their identity for a pan arabist one it s clear that at the beginning that palestinian state hood was only for arab nationalism and it happened across the arab world too when i say arab sudan isn t the first thing that comes to mind yet look at their flag it s literally the pan arabist flag tldr not all arabs are the same palestinians are modern ancestors of the cannites and are thus indeginious so i m just wondering why is it offensive to acknowledge that palestinian identity came through the arabization of this land especially when that s what the history the sourcer and even your own comment suggest i repeat palestinians were arabized but are indeginious yeah i agree with that point the land was arabized and also what exactly do you mean when you say palestinian are you referring to a modern national identity that developed after the s or to anyone who lived here before the state of israel neither i mean modern palestinian peoples even before the arab conquest there were many others and when the romans renamed this land palestina to erase its jewish identity jews didn t start calling themselves palestinians not because they didn t belong here but because the term was created to erase their identity of course they wouldn t adopt a name that was meant to erase them and how is that relevant to palestinian ancestry so when a political movement adopted the name palestine in the twentieth century that doesn t mean it reflects an ancient nation it means it was a modern creation born out of a political moment not historical continuity yeah the land was called cannan at first then israel then palestine imagine modern palestinians wanted to choose a name which one would they choose that doesn t make it illegitimate but it also doesn t make it ancient and if the movement was shaped in part through opposition to israel s existence then isn t that worth examining not to delegitimize it but to understand how identity can sometimes be built in reaction rather than in rooted continuity none of this is meant to deny anyone s lived experience but if we want real understanding we have to be honest about where our identities begin all of them i repeat the last point prior to the land was called by three names israel palestine and cannan which name do you think palestinans would choose', 'first it is not the homeland of most palestinians they came to israel as well during british rule i m not sure that s entirely accurate i d encourage you to read s post specifically the section under myth and take a look at this census report not sure if the photo pops up on mobile from the british a survey of palestine arab illegal immigration is mainly of the types described in the first paragraph of this memorandum as casual temporary and seasonal it is illegal in the sense that the entry and the mode of entry do not conform with the provisions of the immigration ordinance and it is therefore not susceptible of statistical record on the other hand it is not illegal in the sense that the immigrants settle permanently in palestine the main causes of these movements are found in a differences in the crop prospects between palestine and the neighbouring territories and b the attraction of higher wages in palestine when boom conditions exist for example a crop failure in the hauran may lead to a movement into palestine almost entirely masculine in character so that the migrants may acquire funds with which to recoup their losses and on return to their own villages invest in their normal agricultural pursuits conversely if grazing conditions in sinai are more favourable than in palestine there will be an outward movement of the beersheba beduins similarly the boom conditions in palestine in the years led to an inward movement into palestine particularly from syria the depression due to the state of public disorder during led to the return of these people and also to a substantial outward movement of palestinian arabs who thought it prudent to live for a time in the lebanon and in syria that each movement of this kind may lead to a residue of illegal permanent settlers is possible but if the residue were of significant size it would be reflected in systematic disturbances of the rates of arab vital occurrences no such systematic disturbances are observed it is sometimes alleged that the high rate of arab natural increase is due to a large concealed immigration from the neighbouring countries this is an erroneous inference there s more than enough resources to debunk this view and to help you gain a better understanding of the arab population and their historical demographics and personally i know that at least one of my ancestors has been in the region since the byzantine era there was another mass immigration and settlement movement around the same time though however it was not a movement for by arabs hint look into the aliyah jewish immigration waves throughout the late th and th century as well as current rates of jewish immigrants from around the world literally empty desert and marshes just so you understand these days it s still mostly empty and we are million here when you count the entire gaza and wb as well yes you re right i m fairly certain most of israel palestine today is still a desert land obviously with some technological changes and whatnot the amount of uninhabitable desert land or swamps decreased but most of the region is still largely uninhabitable as it s mostly desert in the south second they should have thought of that before they left and maybe declare their intentions for peace as so many arabs did and got full rights and citizenship instead they declared jews as enemies and their leaders attempted to annihilate us instead of accepting the un partition plan not everybody affected by the nakba fled many were expelled also for the first years of israel s existence arab israelis were placed under martial law they did get citizenship but i just thought it s worth mentioning third thinking this is the place of the descendants of the descendants of the descendants despite them not even setting a foot here is extremely delusional interesting does this logic also apply to diaspora jews who sought to make aliyah after all they had been returning to their ancestral homeland despite the fact that most of the jews arriving didn t actually have family there for hundreds or thousands of years forth it doesn t even matter even if you believe this was some sort of injustice thinking we israelis will let millions of palestinians come to our tiny and only piece of land when they all have the declared intention of destroying our country is nothing but extremely unfathomably delusional i agree the right of return is an unrealistic demand it would be bad for israel jewish israelis understandably don t want a massive influx of palestinians into the region because israel could likely cease to exist as a jewish state however at the very least arabs were willing to let jews immigrate to palestine on the condition that arabs would get their independent state there i m not sure if most israelis would accept similar numbers of palestinians coming into israel', 'therefore while israel deserves to exist i do not believe that it was right for the people already living in israel to be cast out have their homes colonized that s not what happened though palestine was a name given to an area not a country when the ottoman empire collapsed we got jordan syria lebanon and iraq nobody disputes these countries that left britain to handle the new land which was a territory called palestine under the ottomans now at this point there were large swathes of land owned by jews for instance tel aviv and the surrounding land etc because the ottomans understood that this was the land of the jews it s judah and sumeria it s their traditional land that being said they were not the majority in all of these areas but there were well established communities and land ownership etc etc so as time went on the arabs which is what they called themselves not palestinians became more and more mad at the amount of jews fleeing pogroms in russia and europe so the british actually barred jewish immigration now i don t think i need to tell you why so many jews needed to leave europe and russia between and but they did and it wasn t until that the ban was lifted and jews were allowed to move to jewish communities in palestine again fast forward to the british want to end the mandate of palestine they don t want to deal with it so they hand it to the league of nations the lon finds that the arabs do not want to live with the jews so they come up with the two state solution in the british leave the jews accept the two state solution and the arabs of palestine syria lebanon and egypt attack the newly founded israel they try to kill all of the jews but they lose in this process two things happened the arab nations ask all the arabs to leave israel until the jews are killed at which point they could return and claim the land and the jews start relocating certain areas thats a lot of typing and i can t explain the entirety of history here without this being a novel but that is how the palestinians ended up leaving some of the land they held it wasn t the jews just kicking the arabs out for nothing there is still of israel that is arab']"

promptly work to undermine it substituting historical fatalism sieges are always tragic for political accountability what you ve provided is a apologia wrapped in military jargon one that tries to normalize rather than confront let s start with what genocide actually means not your preferred reduction of it to industrialized extermination but as defined in international law acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such un convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide this includes not only mass killing but also causing serious bodily or mental harm deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group s destruction and imposing measures intended to prevent births by these criteria it is no longer fringe to call what s happening in gaza plausibly genocidal this isn t a term flung by activists alone it s being used by top un officials including francesca albanese special rapporteur for the occupied palestinian territories who explicitly described israel s actions as meeting the criteria for genocide under the convention over legal scholars and genocide experts including william schabas former head of the un commission on gaza and craig mokhiber who resigned from the un in protest citing a textbook case of genocide the international court of justice icj which in january found south africa s genocide case against israel plausible enough to proceed and issued provisional measures the threshold is not the death toll though as of now over palestinians are dead mostly women and children the threshold is intent method and effect and here the evidence is damning intent israeli leaders have repeatedly used eliminationist language defense minister yoav gallant referred to palestinians as human animals and said we will eliminate everything multiple ministers have spoken of resettlement flattening gaza or cutting off food and water method gaza has been made uninhabitable hospitals bombed water cut aid convoys shot at children dying of starvation on camera while a g backed army bombs rafah this is not incidental it is systematic deprivation effect over of gaza s population has been displaced entire families annihilated thousands of children maimed or orphaned if this is not conditions of life calculated to destroy then the term has no meaning you also suggest that if israel really wanted genocide they d have wiped gaza clean that s like arguing a man accused of attempted murder can t be guilty because his victim survived genocide is not defined by efficiency it s defined by intent and systematic action and israel has the capacity to destroy but opts for prolonged destruction a slow annihilation rather than a rapid one i can t think of any state that would openly declare their genocidal intent and indiscriminately kill it is done more insidiously than that and the idea that population growth disproves genocide is laughable by that logic the rohingya who suffered mass displacement but maintain population numbers in refugee camps were never victims of genocide either a people can continue to exist and still be targeted for destruction in part', 'first of all nobody legitimate is claiming that what israel is doing is a genocide purely because of the death toll maybe some random redditor said that to you in the comments but your post makes it seem like that s a widely held belief listen buddy your experiences are not my experiences you re partially right informed people cite a broader range of reasons but even on reddit and other social media platforms the death toll is constantly used as the centerpiece of moral arguments and the simpletons in question here often blackmail you emotionally because of it stating something along the lines of k dead genocide and they shout this out far more often than references to international law legal thresholds of intent or definitions under the genocide convention that s the bs i was pointing out if sheer body count is your criteria then yes october th would also qualify under that logic even if the execution scale was smaller you can t claim the moral high ground by focusing on outcomes while ignoring intent in actuality the allegations of genocide are usually centered around israel s decision to agreed and i ll even acknowledge that those allegations deserve investigation and scrutiny but israel has stated its intent is to dismantle hamas which is a group that carried out a massacre and openly calls for israel s destruction now can a counterterror campaign go too far and violate humanitarian law of course can a disproportionate response lead to war crimes yes that s why those charges exist separately from genocide but to cross into genocide you must prove intent to destroy a population as such and intent is incredibly hard to prove which is why the bar is so high in international law israeli ministers have made appalling comments but they also exist in a country with a history of internal accountability even if imperfect for hamas that action was confined to a single day years ago so the timeline is your issue and you call my post awful tsk tsk yes it was one day in which over civilians were intentionally murdered women raped families burned alive and children kidnapped that s ideological extermination which also serves as grounds for genocide in intent even if not in scale you don t need to perform mental gymnastics to prove that because hamas s charter calls for the destruction of the jewish state and people they ve said it plainly and repeatedly the only reason october th didn t reach rwanda like numbers is because they were physically stopped the fact that they wanted to go further but couldn t is key you don t get to say well it was just one day when that day s goal was the obliteration of a population genocide has never been about killing as many people as possible in as fast a time as possible it s about destroying a population systematically in whole or in part through a variety of means particularly when trying to do it under international scrutiny yes and israel clearly has the capacity to do more harm than it has it s not something i m suggesting israel should boast about but it s something to note when intent is being questioned if israel truly intended to wipe out palestinians they have the means they haven t that fact alone isn t exoneration but it s relevant to the question of whether genocide is truly underway or whether we re witnessing a brutal counterterror operation against a terror group that embeds itself among civilians by your own example the germans in namibia created death camps however they didn t allow humanitarian corridors they didn t drop leaflets urging evacuation they didn t provide water power or aid after the fighting began israel has done all those things even if insufficiently again i m trying to get it through thick skulls it s not proof of moral purity but it questions intent this post was horrible i would recommend you delete it and try again if you didn t like it that s your opinion but just because you disagree doesn t mean it lacks value the post was simply meant to challenge oversimplified questions like if israel were really trying to defend itself why are so many palestinians dead that question gets asked daily and it deserves a hard uncomfortable answer i tried to provide one', 'seriously stop with the genocide claims the definition of genocide is the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group there are many prominent figures repeating again and again that israel is committing genocide it s actually disgraceful it s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last years that no one cares about or even knows of let me explain why the genocide claims are not true israel has no stated intention of committing genocide the genocidal statements of some israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention they re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way approximately palestinians have died since and most of the deaths have been during war periods this averages out to about per year for reference the nazis killed about million jews per year between and the palestinian population has gone up x since and the gazan population has doubled since israel have gaza back in if they were hell bent on genocide why would they do that israel supplies gaza with free water and electricity until recently a very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide israel provides palestinians with jobs and income another peculiar thing to do if one s intent is to commit genocide israel has tried to offer the palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over a very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people israel provides humanitarian aid to gazans furthermore israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in gaza in the s and s to prop it up and promote health services weird for a genocidal country to do that death toll genocide yes understanding plus gazans have died is not evidence of genocide you must understand why and how they have died did america commit genocide against the japanese iraqis afghans and germans did england commit genocide against the germans turks and italians no of course not they were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life that is not evidence of genocide yes i m sure you can point to a few people in the israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the palestine issue and you can also point to bad apples in the idf who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it however this is not evidence of genocide you actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide i m also referring to raz segal owen jones and norman finkelstein their claims are ridiculous especially coming from university professors and i urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like']"

it only exists in your mind there s no real life proof of anything you re claiming you think i ll just fall for your lies to support your racism and bigotry funny considering you as an ex muslim probably pride yourself in saying there s no proof allah exists it s all made up they re just myths just stories yet when it comes to disproving the same religion and spewing out your bigoted hatred all you can come up with is non factual lies myths and stories when you make your response don t bother trying to convince me islam is bad with random made up stories i don t really care i know you re wrong because i m muslim middle eastern myself in my family we have phd s and my mother and grandmother are responsible for they have held hold some of the highest positions in government have countless achievements have met with presidents and are well respected women to me a woman is sacred on a pedestal i d give up my life to protect theirs this is what i ve always been taught to respect love woman to put them before myself i ve been taught to live this way from islam even after becoming an adult i ve subjected myself to looking in to every aspect of islam to make sure i understand it and that i want to keep practicing it your anecdotal evidence doesn t say anything to me at all because i know i m not a rapist my father isn t my uncles aren t maybe your father is a rapist murderer maybe your brother is a rapist maybe your uncle is a rapist that doesn t make all muslims a rapist murdered i m not here to argue about islam because you ll never be able to convince me now you either

bigoted hatred further on', 'thank you for thinking am a good person i don t know your background story and what led to this belief of yours but ama tell u some of mine i grew up as a muslim by default but not so religious family i had as i got older i started questioning everything not just about islam but about god existence at whole anyway i don t want to get into details but i want to respond to your points i don t believe there is good and bad parts about islam as you said if i love drinking fine wine and my religion says it s forbidden then it s bad part islam forbids sodomy that s true am not going to take what i like and get rid of what i don t and claim allah made a mistake then you didn t really believe from the first place that this is the word of the wise allah you learn what you learned from islam and that s it what i mean by this if i saw a individual claims he she is a muslim and manipulates verses of quran for his her own sake i shouldn t condemn the the quran and the religion it self islam means peace and complete surrender to gods will peace is what really islam represents i stated this point because you said you once argued about how peaceful islam is as like you found out it isn t it still and what that iran point of yours doesn t disapprove that you said my verse applies here also and jews offend muslims by existing obviously that s just a comment of a bias who try to condemn muslims in any way possible like seriously what even makes you say that on what grounds sorry for this long thread but i really hope you re searching for the truth about how all this universe came and what s it s purpose islam didn t convince at first but i searched a lot and i hope you get to the truth one day', 'i studied islam for this exact reason i don t think anyone should have any opinion on anything unless they know what they re talking about i didn t want to not know islam is so complex to understand islam you have to understand muhammed his life the language barrier the intentionally incorrect translations to english and the law of abrogation saying islam is a violent ideology is not an accusation it is simply fact to deny this is a denial of reality even within the laws towards muslims it s legal to beat your wife and execute muslims who do not pray five times a day or renounce the religion or insult or question the prophet or say there is no god it s oppressive and violent for everyone not just non believers it does happen to be an ideology that teaches war there is an entire book dedicated to war in the islamic holy scriptures war is a huge part of it s ideology and frankly it s how it got so big and powerful in the first place we all can study any subject we want and as long as we study it with an open mind i think it s fair to comment on it and offer my take on it muslims can disagree but i just i know i m correct so it doesn t matter also hard to have any conversation with muslims about islam because again it s taught to them and also legal for them to lie about their religion so they can say anything they want they can lie with impunity is not the same but i see the similarities the iraq and afganistan wars were revenge there was a long history with both of those countries though and iraq was pretty much like it probably needed to happen and the reasons were bullshit yes but we knew he has wmd because we gave them to him he just used it all to murder a hundred thousand kurdish men women and children sure i can see this invasion is revenge idk what were the options really allow terrorists to dictate law and have demands met through violence and intimidation is that really an answer either which is worse do you think which would teach people that terrorism gets you the results you want the bigger and worse the terror attack the better the capitulation that s a really bad lesson to teach people in the end i think it s far better to give people a lesson that it doesn t work and won t be answered with demands met and next time you want to do that know what s coming which they did because it s happened many times in the past by now if israel didn t order evacuations and tell people to leave the area that is going to be bombed and invaded i would agree with you but at this point the people that stay are fully aware they are risking their lives and i place the blame on them it s ironic because everyone thinks the jews don t have to fight and for some unknown reason the palestinians get this full pass to fight almost like they have to fight they hold zero responsibility for what has happened for their kids dying because they don t leave and follow orders because they want to fight more than they want their children to live it really is the biggest hypocrisy no matter which way you look at

trying to achieve a peace based on the notion of two states for two peoples it suggests that the palestinians are not going to be content with one state the palestinians are saying at the outset that they want a palestinian state for the palestinian people which we accept but they are also making demands for land inside what everyone recognizes as israel the notion there should be a place no matter what where jews can go for refuge was one of the reasons for the establishment of the state of israel that is a very different than the palestinians saying we want to have a state for our people but we also want land in yours we accept the former we cannot accept the latter i don t know what is wrong with this i see nothing wrong as a two state solution supporter to say that palestinians should have their own state but not be allowed to mass immigrate into israel an entirely different country if the two state solution prevails sounds reasonable to me does it not sound reasonable to you for palestinians to have their own state do you believe that they need israel too are you not a two state solution supporter', 'well at this point the two state solution is just an illusion of the west tbh neither the palestinians nor the israelis want it it s very clear that the palestinians see the entire land as their own and do not want to coexist the slogan from the river to the sea means exactly that what they say in english is very different than what they say in arabic and even if by some miracle the two state solution somehow returns to the negotiations table very unlikely at this point there s still the reasons that caused the negotiations to break down over years ago the matter of jerusalem which the palestinians see as their capital and will never give up and that israel will never concede on because it has the holiest sites to judaism and also there s the matter of the so called right of return which the palestinians refused to give up on and that israel would not allow because if you include all the descendants of those who fled israel in they are more than the number of jews in israel i e israel will no longer be a jewish state either that or become an apartheid state in other words f ed either way as far as what israelis believe there are some far right israelis who just like the palestinians believe that the entire land is theirs and all palestinians should be gone but even those in the center of the political map reject the notion of the two state solution because they see the palestinian narrative and believe that this lead to the opposite of peace i e that the palestinian state would become an enemy country and it would be a lot more difficult for the idf to uproot palestinian terrorism once it involves invading a sovereign state as for the one state solution the israelis outright reject that for the exact same reason they reject the right of return because demographics highly favor the palestinians', 'but how could palestinians sustain investment and energies to create a thriving palestinian state when israeli leadership since rabin has progressively often explicitly ruled out a palestinian state i disagree with that premise peres and barak olmert sharon all supported a palestinian state even netanyahu openly supported a palestinian state in not to mention israel acceptance of a palestinian state back in israeli center left leaders bet and lost their political careers over it i don t know how old you are but i remember how serious the israeli public was about this israelis seriously and truly believed that the palestinian state is near for better or worse the palestinian public on the other hand might ve accepted the two states solution for a while but not israel remaining a jewish state i ve been following opinion polls since the second intifada and support for the full right of return was incredibly high throughout even while most supported the two state solution there s a reason why netanyahu could so simply thwart abbas attempts for peace negotiations by simply making him promise to acknowledge israel as a jewish state even though abbas was personally willing to compromise on the right of return his constituents absolutely weren t say whatever you want about einat wilf as a politician but she s been far more intimately involved in this process than either of us i don t think she became a right winger or part of the racist ideological israeli government i trust her when she says that the palestinians never gave up on the right of return and the elimination of israel as a jewish state and that any attempt for peace must first start with a fundamental shift in the palestinian national identity that s built first and foremost on reverting the offense of israel s creation not having a palestinian state next to a jewish one all the while settling the would be palestinian state with israelis all it means that the would be palestinian state would either give up the small israeli majority part of its territory for the fenced off areas according to peace now and or do the unthinkable and allow them to become palestinian citizens i m not sure why we decided that palestine has to be a racially pure arab ethnostate and couldn t have a and more likely much less than that jewish minority while israelis can have a palestinian arab minority and still be racist ideologues and denying palestinians permits to build their future state i m not sure what permits the palestinians were denied to build their future state but i d just note that israelis built their state under pretty severe british restrictions and with far less initial autonomy than the palestinians have been enjoying for the past years furthermore i d note that if the palestinians wanted to solve the issue of permits in area c if that s what you mean and settlement growth they would ve collectively accepted the idea of living next to a jewish state rather than hamas blowing up buses in tel aviv to prevent it from happening and graduating to a full on bipartisan wave of terror in the s this narrative suffers from the same issue as all the israel is the one who doesn t want peace narratives it would always remain an untested theory since the arabs keep providing these convenient excuses by refusing peace and starting war after war after war afterall the early zionists sustained a vision and prepared for a future state based on a written promise what do you mean the balfour declaration that explicitly didn t promise a state but a mere jewish national home after the zionists themselves decided to accept something much less than a state and less than the palestinians were offered during ottoman times just so they d have some kind of polity and then the british violated in pretty direct ways to try to placate the arabs or do you mean the partition plan that was thrown in the trash more or less immediately after it was issued by most of the world powers that voted for it and frankly by that point the zionists already had a proto state that would evolve into a state with or without this promise furthermore it s important to note that this was as much of a written promise to the palestinians to have their first state in history as to the israelis and if they accepted it it would actually come true the reasons for why they rejected it and why the israelis accepted it never really changed and yes i can absolutely blame the palestinians for that']"

uninhabitable how will israel resettle in gaza this was not about hamas yeah israel is an evil genius withdrawing from gaza in expelling about k jews and wait for the palestinians to start a war to have an excuse to come back to gaza years later bombing hospitals schools cultural centers which are legitimate targets under ihl since hamas uses these places to carry out military operations starving the population there are dozens of aid trucks coming into gaza hamas are stealing that aid from palestinians israel can t control that so it s not israel s fault the point was to make life there impossible and then give the population the option of moving which comes back to my first points the surrounding states understandably want no part in this transparent ethnic cleansing they don t want to take part in taking in palestinians because they don t want palestinians they saw what happened to jordan and lebanon have nothing to do with ethnic cleansing it can be said on ukraine russia war too are you suggesting that the countries that took in ukrainians are collaborating with ethnic cleansing', 'i m an egyptian if this matters here s the reasons our economy is in shambles

family is considered from the upper middle class most of them being doctors and dentists yet still can t find their medications because of its scarcity taking in thousands of gazans will put us in a more downward spiral than we already are it s not something egypt can currently handle with out economy at all gazans fleeing means gaza gets colonised by israel then palestinians lose it less palestine land to live on means more homeless palestinians and more power for the colonisation why would we want the colonisation to have more power and the palestinians to lose more and more of their homes doesn t make sense this will be an official resignation of land while if they stay in gaza israel can t do much without being seen in bad light edit lol the downvotes only cause i said egypt is in the worst economic state it has ever been and doesn t have the ability to defend itself against the colonisation if they take gaza crazy when saying the obvious truth makes people downvote you just look up wages in egypt in the public sector and prices of everything plus how much the usd is worth in egypt i m not lying to deserve any downvotes this subreddit seems to be people blindly wanting palestinians out of gaza no matter the cost not thinking of how that will affect anyone else sorry we don t all live in rich countries like the eu we live in egypt and we have to live through not having electricity for a minimum of minutes daily because of our horrible economy just how it is yet you expect us to welcome million gazans in when we are overpopulated and have enough homeless people as is', 'first of all idea that anyone in gaza chose to be palestinian is simply untrue no one in gaza chose to be palestinian any more than someone in ireland chose to be irish or someone in poland chose to be polish which is to say that people are born into their national and ethnic identities even if they weren t what is someone who was born in gaza supposed to be it s not like they can become israeli citizens nor do they have a legal pathway to citizenship elsewhere next the idea that nobody forces people to live in palestine is not only factually wrong but the implication is also deeply disturbing this is a weird lie considering how forcefully palestinians are prevented from leaving most gazans are stateless and hold only palestinian authority travel documents which many countries don t accept for visas or entry without recognized citizenship moving abroad permanently is extremely difficult even if they did have passports the exits are tightly controlled egypt controls the southern crossing and does not let people pass freely and israel controls all of gaza s airspace coastline and all other land crossings if a gazan does leave there s no guarantee they ll be permitted to return to their home even for family emergencies because israel and egypt control re entry even if a gazan did manage to leave the implication that their very presence in gaza justifies bigotry against them is deeply disturbing it treats their displacement as a reasonable solution rather than recognizing it as the central injustice of the conflict next you suggest that all palestinians have an exterminationist ideology have you looked at polling from gaza which shows that the vast majority of them do not want to exterminate israel the same cannot be said of israelis of whom support the forced displacement of palestinians from gaza according to a recent poll from haaretz even hamas has accepted israel s defacto right to exist but even if it hadn t palestinians are not synonymous with hamas just as jews are not synonymous with the israeli government reducing an entire ethnic group to a political position is the textbook definition of bigotry and then finally there s your nazi jew analogy which i m still not sure i understand it seems like you re trying to say well if palestinians want to destroy israel then it s fine to dehumanize them just like it would have been fine for jews to dehumanize nazis in wwii but it s really not the same being palestinian is an ethnic national identity you are born into while being a nazi is an ideology you can join or leave like i mentioned there is no monolithic political movement in palestine millions of palestinians have nothing to do with hamas or armed resistance also equating palestinians with nazis assumes every member of the group shares a single genocidal intent that s the same logic antisemites have historically used against jews and then lastly your analogy is wrong bc you need to be for real about who is actually persecuting who here in wwii jews were the powerless targeted minority and nazis were the state perpetrators of genocide in your analogy palestinians are the stateless militarily occupied population so if anything they re closer to the jews in that historical relationship than to the nazis']"

egypt are blocking entry of aid to gaza israel tightly controls all entry points and decides what can and cannot enter israel does not want aid to enter in mass and so it does not if jordan didn t want to send food into gaza why would they be airdropping it in even if they could unilaterally drive aid across the border without israel s permission there are significant concerns about whether aid workers would be safe from the idf if aid isn t approved by israel israel does have a policy that creates conditions that are unsurvivable in the long term they are aware of this and continue the blockade nonetheless they are responsible for the blockade and for its reasonably foreseeable consequences now let s move onto the claims that starvation is due to hamas stealing the food there simply isn t evidence of this happening at a significant scale of course it likely happens but it s not plausible that they are responsible for the famine frankly if they were stealing significant amounts of food famine would have set in far earlier than it has one thing i ve never seen anyone properly address is the question of where hamas are putting all of this food to induce famine they would need to steal and store destroy huge quantities of food and sustain these efforts over many months have we seen any evidence of large fires of burning food or millions of meals worth of foodstuff stored in hamas tunnels no we have not now the reasons for egypt and jordan not accepting mass refugees are less clear cut public statements from both are that if they accept refugees israel will annex gaza and never allow them to return given the rhetoric of israeli ministers these concerns are justified jordan already has million palestinian refugees the influx of refugees altered the social fabric of the country so significantly that there isn t an appetite for any more large population transfers especially as no one believes that these would be temporary ethically less clear cut', 'ok i ll let the article speak for itself the flour and rice come from donations gathered by the un and international humanitarian groups who usually buy the food in the west bank jordan or abroad and transport it through israel to gaza according to humanitarian sources the idf does not allow the supplies to be properly secured before trucks leave kerem shalom to enter the areas where starving gazans live sources in gaza report that idf soldiers rush aid workers to load cargo quickly then trucks are often delayed for hours and forced to take dangerous routes because the food isn t securely tied down it s easy to steal and most of the aid entering gaza is looted on the way some food also spills due to severe road damage for months the un and humanitarian aid groups have pleaded with the idf to allow food to enter through other crossings to give them time to secure and protect shipments and to use safer routes to ensure aid reaches those in need their requests have been repeatedly denied this is just one of many obstacles that israel places in the way of feeding gaza s residents and stopping the hunger crisis on the surface there is a puzzling gap between israel s repeated claims of increasing food supplies to gaza and the ongoing daily reports of deaths from starvation and severe malnutrition especially among children obstacles imposed by israel diaspora affairs minister amichai chikli has blocked dozens of organizations attempting to deliver aid police have failed to provide the necessary escort for trucks crossing from the jordanian border the idf delays trucks at the kerem shalom crossing and limits loading times which impacts drivers ability to secure the cargo the kerem shalom crossing is closed on fridays and saturdays aid workers and international volunteers are not permitted to enter gaza through kerem shalom at the same time as the trucks the idf has established checkpoints within gaza that impede the movement of trucks gaza s social order is rapidly deteriorating because many police officers have been targeted by the idf unrwa s activities are being disrupted restrictions persist on the entry of certain medical supplies and foods the reason is that humanitarian organizations and un agencies including the world food program unicef the world health organization and dozens more have been unable to rebuild the food distribution network that operated in gaza before the current crisis began on march at that time israel closed the border crossings for days entirely causing the network to collapse', 'your post is dripping with sarcasm and outrage at this moment there are current global conflicts with more casualties and more displaced than the israel gaza war but fine you ve chosen this one as your hill to die on so the problem is that hamas has stolen the food and aid that has gone in to gaza previously stolen from the civilian population stolen food and medicine from starving children that need it this has made it challenging to get food to the people that need it you may or may not know that the palestinian peace advocate ahmed fouad alkhatib recommended parachuting aid in because it was harder to intercept which israel and other countries were doing i don t blame you for being concerned when i googled whether people were starving here were the headlines nbc starvation looms as israel s total blockade on gaza enters its third month starvation is not happening but it looms al jaz updates israel kills world complicit in starvation of gaza children note no mention if the were all hamas part hamas and the implicit call for nations to do something and of course the mention of children again current conflicts in the world in similar or worse situation un news gaza worst case scenario unfolds as brutal aid blockade threatens mass starvation note it is not here yet but threatening un news gazans face hunger crisis as aid blockade nears two months bbc news gaza mass starvation warning the strangest thing is that israel is expected to deliver food to its enemy as if england delivered food to the germans in ww in any event there is a story days ago about idf planning major shift in gaza aid delivery in bid to thwart hamas diversion the plan is that international organizations and private security contractors will hand out boxes of food to individual gazan families the whole sale distribution of food wasn t working because it was all being stolen by the criminally unethical hamas and its palestinian supporters in the new plan each family will have a designated representative tasked with reaching a security zone in southern gaza where aid will be distributed each box will have enough food to last several days then the family representatives return to the security zone to receive the next parcel israel believes this method will make it harder for hamas to divert aid to its fighters interestingly now qatar and egypt are supporting an initiative calling for days of calm that would see the release of the remaining israeli captives in exchange for allowing food and shelter i m hopeful and i hope you are as well that hamas will accept this qatar egypt plan they have been prolonging a lot

there are currently different armed conflicts playing out across the world stage but the world only cares about one the pro palestine wing didn t have a word to say about the we want to live movement

supporting palestine certainly i support the civilians of gaza i m sure you heard about the we want to live movement the release of whispered in gaza a series of interviews with architects of participants in the aforementioned movement was also extremely illuminating for me i don t believe it has to be either or i can support the civilians of israel and the civilians of palestine i can want all of my peoples to enjoy peace and freedom for me it isn t a conflict of interest so much of the population in gaza is comprised of teens well about years ago hamas started producing and distributing children s programming to the children of gaza i ve watched it it teaches children that to die for the cause is the highest ideal to which they could possibly aspire these poor kids their brains still developing have been brainwashed damn near since birth i have a great deal of sympathy for them my heart genuinely aches for those kids people in power have been molding them into the perfect little child soldiers their whole lives ppl wanna talk ethnic cleansing okay let s talk syria used to have jews now they literally have where are the jews of syria now lebanon used to have jews now they have and can t even practice their faith publicly where are the jews of lebanon now at one time egypt had jewish residents now there are literally jews in the entire country where did the jews of egypt go at one time algeria had jews now there s where are their jews tunisia had jews now there s idk where d they go libya had jews now they don t have a single one in iraq had jews as

writing this post it did my heart good to see it', 'it s hard to reply when you start saying for those who truly believe israel has done little to nothing wrong because even being pro israel if you are trying to use logic and not passion or irrational arguments it s impossible to deny that israel has done a lot of things wrong and the secondary part is also ignoring so many other facts but none of them makes me believe that i should be like the mainstream pro palestine because none of their arguments are logical and shows a complete use of emotion and lack of understanding of history or even point out history from years ago and an attempt to erase history and reset by not having israel to exist in the present at all this is so absurd that i cannot ever agree with this main pro palestine view to specify i was always pro israel and indifferent to palestine having studied more about the conflict made me even more pro israel and more pro palestine at the same time i can be very critical of israel and its government decisions while also holding palestinian government accountable both pa and hamas while at the same time i want both people to exist in security and with dignity any other logic different than that it s immoral to me which is why i will never support the mainstream pro palestine movement oh by the way the main pro palestine movement loves to claim that even palestinians and gazans who are moderate and have a similar view to mine as paid zios hasbarah traitor how can i ever support people who can t listen to palestinians or gazans just because they don t agree with them so i guess this should answer your question for moral clarity i cannot and will not ever support the mainstream pro palestine movement when and if they stop asking for the erasure of jewish

fucked the free palestine movement is years ago everyday gazans attempted to peacefully protest the abysmal economic conditions being imposed upon them the top leaders of hamas were worth a combined b while even prior to unemployment was at and the average income was about usd per month income tax could be up to hamas levies a fee on virtually every single financial transaction that happens in gaza etc the protests were brutally suppressed mass arrests torture and beatings in prisons protesters homes were broken into and trash protesters families were threatened with and sometimes suffered physical violence even amnesty international a notoriously anti israel acknowledges that all of this happen hamas torments women children religious and ethnic minorities political dissidents peaceful protesters etc they are one of the greatest authors of palestinian suffering on the planet and in the history i didn t see the west say a word not a single protest not a single social media post when my people were being beaten and tortured in dank prisons why do they only care about gazan suffering when jews are involved why wasn t the free palestine movement expressing mass solidarity via activism back then no jews no news from toddlerhood palestinian children are taught that martyrdom ought to be their highest aspiration the movement cares about none of this they ve accomplished exactly nothing to meaningfully improve everyday gazans day to day material conditions and that s because the movement is nothing more than a genocidal campaign being waged by the very people terrorizing the most vulnerable citizens of the middle east and northern africa also people love to say this didn t start in october until i say you re right let s talk about how jerusalem grand mufti al husseini had warm relationships of admiration with the hitler regime had an apartment in germany where he was treated quite lavishly by said nazi regime wrote about his desire to enact his own final solution once germany succeeded and the impact that has had on the palestinian consciousness then suddenly they don t want to talk about history anymore i have so much more to say on this i m getting ahead of myself i am so grateful for your post it is lonely over here but i have absolute unshakeable confidence that affirming israel s right to exist and resisting the islamic republic and

from a soviet union propaganda tactic from the s created solely to enable them to persecute jews after it had become illegal post ww the arab world latched onto this propaganda due to their close relationship with the soviet union russia the kgb and their love for antisemitic nazi propaganda this is basic and recent history but bad actors have removed it from school curriculum on purpose i can t believe educated ppl are falling for literal soviet era propaganda but that s how indoctrination operates our educational institutions have long been compromised by bad actors and the congressional investigations into their funding from our enemies is finally bringing what jews have known for a long time into public awareness islamic groups have openly shared their plans to infiltrate and indoctrinate the west was even a huge theme of the holy land foundation case in i think it was but no one seems to be listening seems like a case of the bigotry of low expectations a very common phenomenon on the left they are not only very capable of doing this if you look around you can see they have succeeded zionism has existed for as long as judaism and it predates its modern political connotations it is the yearning for the jewish return to our home zion and the belief in the self determination of jews in our ancestral homeland supported by every area of scientific research archaeology genetics and documented history as an indigenous ethnic religion ancient beliefs mythology and laws of the jewish tribe who originated in the land of israel judaism is inextricably connected to the land itself this propaganda about zionism judaism shows an inherent lack of understanding of what judaism even is any other meaning is intended to sell you something antizionism is what s actually racist other than a shared belief in a state for jews zionists span the political spectrum and may have nothing else in common so to assign bad qualities such as nazism white supremacy etc to zionists doesn t even make logical sense zionists can be anything from human rights advocates to religious right wing extremists zionism itself is neutral the belief that jews should be allow to exist and self govern after centuries of pogroms genocides and subjugation under the rule of others should not be a bipartisan issue it s a matter of basic human rights that all nations are entitled to if only the anti racists knew they were pushing the most racist anti indigenous goal of all the genocide and ethnic cleansing of jews and the denial of our indigeneity and right to live in our ancestral homeland imagine if they did this to first nations native americans they would never but bc it s jews it s ok age old antisemitism dressed up social justice language is still age old jew hatred for op zionism as racism the soviet ploy used to explain israel and hamas bad actors using buzzwords and changing their meanings or keeping their definitions vague is a well known propaganda tactic called the placard strategy apartheid genocide concentration camp zionism racism war crime colonialism etc the fact that no pro hamas people seem to know the definition of zionism when you ask is a red flag placard strategy is why you see pro hamas people almost always devolving into shouting random buzzwords instead of engaging in thoughtful discussions bc they don t actually know the meanings behind the words they re using the palestine propaganda complex the palestinian movement has hijacked the meaning of words in the first step words such as palestine colonialism refugee return justice semites occupation apartheid and genocide are chosen for their current associations and significations either with jews or with evil these words are then emptied of any of their original specific meanings and imbued with new and unique interpretations that either invert the original association or simply become removed from it typically this involves taking the words out of their historical context and putting them into a new decontextualized and ahistorical world the words are then used for the singular purpose of portraying collective jews especially those among them who dared seek sovereignty in their homeland or who support that enterprise as uniquely evil most people in the west don t realize they are actively involved in this tiny war halfway around the world and have been for decades bc most of all this is an information propaganda war more than a physical one and our enemies rely on us being misinformed ignorant angry and extreme in our ideology because this is how they will meet their goals the destruction of the jewish state and ultimately western civilization it s imperative we are aware and second guess everything we see from both sides', 'there aren t different definitions of zionism zionism is exactly how it defined by there are different types of zionists which believe in different ways to achieve the zionist goal this doesn t change the definition of zionism the protesters are not anti kahanist zionism or anti revisionist zionism they proudly present themselves as anti zionism almost everyone who s anti zionism will have no idea what you re talking about they hold that zionism is bad and israel doesn t have a right to exist which contradicts your argument further you claim the protests are against kahana zionism which didn t exist when israel became a state even the revisionist were a small minority in the zionist movement the labour were the majority and the main leadership so if the anti zionism is not against the jewish self determination then why are they against israel s existence you can play with language all you want but to the masses anti zionism means anti zionism and that is putting aside that s your definition isn t quite correct about what the kahana and revisionist zionists believe', 'people don t know what zionism means and it s ruining like of the discourse people don t know what zionism is and that s really scary and yes the meaning of this word is incredibly important i see a lot of people claiming to be antizionist while not being antisemitic and i don t think people understand what antizionism means at all the contemporary definition ever since the creation of israel in the preservation of the existence of the jewish state that s it if you think israel should be on a map and then you are a zionist the contemporary definition of anti zionism ever since the creation of israel in is the negation of the definition of zionism which would be the end of the existence of the jewish state if you think something should happen that dissolves the state of israel then you are an anti zionist that s the extent of the word zionism it has nothing to do with the settlements or with the executive office and yes i m aware that settlers are zionists but guess what the palestinian israeli citizens that had to flee hamas and were taken in and naturalized by israel are also zionists the druze and the christians the secular people and the muslims in israel all are zionists with the obvious exceptions of radical anarchist individuals in every society even the adl knows anti zionism has been bastardized into a antisemitic dogwhistle and is now being used by people who simply oppose netanyahu unaware of the word s definition if you ve wondered why you ve been called antisemitic for calling yourself antizionist thinking it means i oppose israel s military but i still think israel should exist then you are in fact a zionist which isnt a bad thing you ve just been gaslit or misinformed into thinking zionism jews when they re bad this is the most important takeaway from from the adl anti zionism is distinct from criticism of the policies or actions of the government of israel or critiques of specific policies of the pre state zionist movement in that it attacks the foundational legitimacy of jewish statehood zionism pro settlements zionism pro netanyahu zionism pro jews anti

take it from the israeli government x b on the same international field in this game of delegitimization and think about it for a moment the palestinian authority is a burden and hamas is an asset it

something like likud is the leading party in the national camp israeli politics are nothing like us politics there have been political parties in israel since there are currently political parties it is obvious how much likud netanyhau are disliked which is part of the reason that israel has had elections in the past years that would be like the u s having presidential elections since biden got elected likud got the majority of votes but not enough to form a government all of netanyahu s governments are formed by an unholy alliance of disparate ideologies why did likud even get as many votes as they did despite those horrible settler platforms that you state above because netanyahu likud have been viewed as the party that can keep israelis safe many people who vote for likud don t agree with most of the policies you state above but shockingly they do want to stay alive even more astounding they want their children to stay alive and at years of age nearly all israelis women and men must serve in the idf so israelis would prefer not to have a war where their children are likely to die and after the intifadas when thousands of israelis were murdered by horrific terror attacks israelis had enough of palestinians terror both hamas and pa and the pay to slay policy of the pa it was obvious to israelis and even more obvious now that palestinians have no desire to live in peace in a palestinian state side by side with israelis if you had no where else to go and israelis have no other country and your neighbors had shown over and over again that their only reason for living is to murder you and you want stay alive you would also vote for the party that promised to keep you safe to hell with all their racist and ideologically unpleasant platforms and that is why likud will be voted out now because they failed to protect israelis on their entire approach to placating hamas is viewed as a failure and a direct cause of the tortures murders rapes and kidnappings that occurred on', 'no one says israel netanyahu funded hamas directly but rather that they allowed qatari money to flow into gaza to the hands of hamas since hamas has been the governing force in gaza it runs social programs and police and the government structure schools and hospitals are funded largely by the un and donors thus the money that hamas received can be thought of as money that is meant for welfare development governance etc in gaza israel and specifically netanyahu would say something like we want them to be able to have some basic living standards and we want it to go through us so that they have some incentive to play ball and keep quiet it was known that a lot of this money goes to building tunnels and buying weapons but not letting the money through without any substitute funding for the civil governance would be very problematic too i think the thing we can blame netanyahu for in this context is that he was comfortable with this ugly status quo which would somewhat predictably lead to a major attack instead of being serious about a peace process with the palestinians hamas is evil but in a diplomatic sense what it did was saying we re not willing to live like this for so long the occupation is bad and we need to end it of course the stated ideology of hamas is that there should be no israel but that doesn t mean that every ounce of support given to hamas would back this hawkish stance in isolation if the gazans were under the impression that a deal that gives them a state is imminent they would not support hamas so much or perhaps the hamas apparatus would become more dovish as for what bibi knew or didn t know i think it s kind of like the aftermath of you can point now at a million ways the cia fbi nsa could have busted the operation ahead of time but that doesn t mean anybody committed treason for one as it were hindsight is i e the fact it s obvious now doesn t mean it was obvious at the time second we may think that some of the indications should have been picked up on but that just means the relevant people in the government and security apparatus should have done a better job there were some indications on the night before

person who is pro one side is less educated if you are pro one side you definitely didnt take the time to internalize how complex the situation is now saying that nelson mandela said israel is an apartheid state is an appeal to authority which is no offence a tool utilized more by the uneducated who practice critical thinking less the claim that mandela said it doesn t make it true even the claim itself is disputed can you provide a source that mandela believed israel is an apartheid state first we must accept that apartheid is a spectrum not a binary every society has a certain degree is apartheid characteristics in it second we need to define what apartheid is and whether israel practices it your definition alludes to racism but racism is inarguably prevalent in every society apartheid is not the same for one apartheid by the very definition means separation or as it is understood today segregation does israel practice segregation absolutely not all israeli citizens regardless of racism ethnicity religion etc are equal and can generally go wherever they want there are laws against segregation does israel put the west bank under military control in order to protect settlers who are illegally there absolutely there are a few exceptions which are highly controversial which is why i said apartheid is a spectrum one is the city of hebron in the west bank where jews and palestinians are separated by force this has been put due to numerous clashes between the populations imo the jews there should just leave another issue is that jews are not allowed into the temple mount and al aqsa mosque inside again the reason is security just to quickly address the other claims the claim about ethiopian jews is blatantly false the majority stand with israel they complain about racism not segregation there are way fewer issues with the west bank even though the settlers there keep abusing them i m not suggesting an explanation just saying what you said is not true i would argue that most israelis so want a two state solution that was the goal for the oslo accords although it failed i think that the sentiment among the majority still prefers a two state solution over occupation the only fear is that the palestinian state will not stop pursuing the ambition to remove all jews from the territory and to finish i am personally pro forgetting the past and finding a solution for the future both sides will have to make compromises', 'reply to a challenge to those who claim israel is an apartheid state failing to answer so posting a new thread here are reasons why israel cannot even resemble an apartheid state i challenge you to give even only breasons why you think it is so let s go over you claims i do suspect however that you are looking for equivalence i e you want south african apartheid and israeli apartheid to be exactly the same they are not israel to its credit is smarter than rsa and does many of the egregious things nicely under the table see below all people living in israel have equal rights there are no inferior or second class citizens unlike non whites in south africa or minorities in islamic or arab countries this claim is false one very simple example some israeli citizens do not have the right or ability to be married in the state of israel simply due to their ethno religious status indeed if you wish to explore this particular region of israeli inequality in depth there are actually five classes of citizens dm me for a more in depth answer another example an additional and completely different set of some people who reside in an area israel has annexed legally or illegally is irrelevant for this portion of the discussion were not granted citizenship at the time of annexation or since i speak of course of the residents of jerusalem the east portion of which was annexed by israel disenfranchising its population and we should also mention some people in the west bank who while residing in an area occupied by israel for some years are subject to military law and lack franchise these people despite being in israel s loving iron grip lack the most basic rights of any kind this very basic and first instance is in itself sufficient to label israel as apartheid you know just slightly pregnant is fully pregnant an arab judge george karra sentenced an ex israeli president moshe kansas to prison for years what has this to do with israel being or not being an apartheid state a judge who happened to be an arab sentenced a rapist who happened to be an ex president to prison again you seem to be looking for equivalence with rsa israel and rsa are not the same in the bantu education act was passed in south africa setting up a different educational system for blacks to focus on manual labor jobs in israel everyone is given equal opportunity in the workplace and educational department as evidenced by the fact there are palestinians and arabs in israeli universities who both study and teach as professors your comments on the israeli educational system is misleading first arab and moslem teachers are not found in the jewish educational systems there are three or four separate of the latter the orthodox religious educational systems do not accept anyone but their own specific ilk of people the national religious accept only national religious and orthodox religious and the national system accepts anyone who happens to be jewish without formally saying no arabs unless an arab actually is considered for a position at which point parents outcries are usually enough to make an arab teacher not the right fit at this point in time so sad so sad additionally up until all arab teachers has to be vetted by the general security service gss and would you believe it at this time i e in this vetting is in the process of being reinstated by the current government incitement to racism is a criminal offense in israel you are absolutely right and yes i can give many more examples just tell me where you want them from arabs and israelis receive the same care and treatment in the same hospitals that is for now correct of course the current minister of finance non whites in south africa had separate amenities hospitals beaches bathrooms even park benches they were allowed to sit on that is correct israel has no bits like this but see you point above and my answer to it no it has not yet happened israeli arabs have their own political parties in the knesset some of whom are israel s harshest critics but in rsa blacks had their own autonomies countries almost they were better off just kidding yes arabs have their own parties arab citizens are allowed to seek redress through the courts and government if they feel they have been wronged true arabs in israel have more fundamental rights than other islamic and arab countries in the middle east ironically they have more rights than they do in the gaza strip or the west bank irrelevant we are discussing israel s apartheid not the failures and these are numerous of arab states incitement israel there are million arab citizens integrated within israeli society they make up percent of israel s population according to a poll done by harvard university percent of arabs citizens living in israel would rather live there than any other country in the world if these citizens were experiencing apartheid why are so many supportive of israel there is no equivalence first million arabs are not the entirety of israeli arab population you must need include the residents of jerusalem and the million residents of the occupied west bank even without including the two latter groups israel has multiple citizen classes regimentalizing their access to citizens rights access to work this is a separate issue that should be discussed and other sundry matters no israel s apartheid is not south african apartheid but it is an apartheid separate and different ethnical groups having separate and unequal rights and treatment', 'israel is an apartheid state']"

muslim countries don t but it does legally recognize any marriage performed abroad including the new utah zoom option that emerged during covid so there s no gay marriage performed locally only because none of the religious bodies authorized to perform marriages the orthodox rabbinate the sharia courts and the churches happen to perform gay marriage if for instance the rabbinate changed its mind on same sex marriage it would be instantly legal for jews in israel the sharia system in israel does allow muslim men to marry non muslim women in a muslim wedding ceremony so that s legal the rabbinate won t perform intermarriage and neither will druze imams but i m not sure about the christian churches israel does however have a domestic partnership status that s open to both hetero and same sex couples as well as mixed faith couples which has many of the same rights and benefits as marriage so many gay couples will do that and do a legal wedding ceremony next time they re able to take a trip abroad the lack of a local legal option for same sex marriage is certainly an issue and it s something people advocate for but it s not something that the local lgbtq community considers to be terribly oppressive due to the above mentioned loopholes and alternatives available and gay couples are still able to adopt children and use surrogates', 'so i want to chime in here i m muslim obviously pro palestine and cannot believe the evilness that is taking place by the hands of israel and the us providing them support i have been to pro palestine protests and cannot believe the amount of lgbt people there it is not a problem for them to be there everyone should be standing up for human rights for the lives of innocents lost no matter who they are what bothers me is they come with their rainbow flags they come with signs gays for palestine here s the thing your sexuality has nothing to do with standing up for the lives of innocent families innocent children you are a human standing for human rights and that is enough please keep your rainbow flags out of the picture for those of us who stand up for palestine the issue we are standing up for is the sanctity of human life we are standing against cruelty if you want to join by all means join but do not make the palestinian lives lost about you we don t care about your sexuality in fact we find it unnatural and are against your moral values we don t agree with you we treat you with respect because you are human beings and all human beings should be treated with respect and kindness but again keep your rainbow flags away it sends the wrong message to those around us who are unaware of what s happening in palestine it sends them the message that this is a queer leftist movement and it is the opposite islam is against all acts of sexual immorality including the lgbt lifestyle and sexual relationships outside of marriage the people being killed in palestine include everyone but mostly muslims it is offensive for us that you being your sexuality into it that you being your flags when we are crying about children being killed and our government s participation palestine has nothing to do with queers keep your movement out of our movements show up as a human being showing up for humanity without your rainbow slogans thank you', 'there is no holocaust or genocide in gaza i agree but if there

top meme is so dangerous as so long that s the standard being compared israel can criminalize transitioning roll back all protections for gay rights and even make showing non heterosexual romance illegal and be seen as more enlightened everyone makes fun of queers for palestine because your not a serious movement i ll be honest most of the people who make fun of queers for palestine just tend to also hate queer people bench the only orgasmic glee they go into into describing how palestinians wouldtrow them off rooftops queers for palestine have never once put forth a real solution for the

worry or concern for queer rights outside of fearmongering about muslims and or arabs ill prove your not serious or have any idea about the conflict by asking one question if you actually care about the gaza civilians and dont want to see them killed then which palestine political party do you want to run gaza hamas islamic jihad or fatah eh i d prefer a center far left coalition of israelis occupy and deradilize the population of gaza for a while until a more moderate political party could take root and begin the process of a formal separation but unfortunately israel is ruled by auotocrats and fascists who d expand into and displace gazans altogether the soviets couldn t decradlize people who were radicalized by nazism as they were also totalitarian barring that my ideal

to do it in defense sometimes hamas even misses and hit gaza and their own civilians so you honestly think that israel should just not defend itself and just not fire back at hamas just because hamas uses its own people to shield itself i don t know where you re from but what would your own country do your own country would literally ignore all those bombs coming at them and just say well they re firing from an apartment building and they have a huge rocket inventory in there but heck with it we ll just let them keep doing it no your own country wouldn t do that either it s actually more

is not a regular army some even call them terror group netanyahu called them sick animals or sth like that so why setting such a high standards now israel s regular army should respect international law but they obviously don t which is much more shocking and sick they have been quoted multiple times stating how civilian deaths are how they hope to pressure israel do show me where they said they want more civilians killed hoping that international community will pressure israel because it kills too many civilians does not equal wanting lots of your own civilians getting killed can t you see the difference hamas hopes and counts on israel not to strike civilian targets but israel does it anyways that s why they are accused of war crimes that is using civilians as human shields and the only way it makes them not easy targets is because it makes them harder to discriminate them from civilians again it s israeli army that is ready to strike civilian objects and kill civilians as collateral damage no one forces israel to do that and it was idf that used palestinians as human shields on tank it was even recorded on video but i bet you will call it isolated incident as you usually do when it comes to israel then you should be against hamas using violent means pick one nah we saw that when palestinians tried peaceful way without any violence for example under abbas israel simply continued building illegal settlements and building wall so this didn t bring palestinians anywhere armed resistance is therefore necessary as a part of effort to show israel that there will be no peace until they get a state mind you i said a part i think combination of initial armed resistance and later via negotiations is the only way didn t israel also resort to radical movements

situation where no one can tell anymore who is a civilian and who is a fighter by doing so they are endangering everyone by making them a target israel has no way of knowing which targets are actually civilians and which are just pretending to be israel like every country in the world has to defend itself and its citizens now i am very sure they would prefer a clean fight against hamas fighters with no involvement of any civilians but that s not happening anytime soon hamas does not do clean fights they are cowards they will continue to hide amongst the people they really should be protecting what is israel supposed to do just retreat and accept to never be able to live in peace accept all the bombings from hamas accept their own civilians having to run to bomb shelters all the

they wouldn t be doing anything in their power by any means necessary so i can live in peace in the home i built every war is messy this one even more than others i blame hamas they are the one who started something they couldn t finish they are the ones that play stupid games and hide amongst civilians causing all this mess they are the ones who do not care how many people die you can be sure their leaders are celebrating what happened today because of what it does to public opinion they want as many and as tragic deaths as possible israel doesn t the idf is not perfect but if they had the same mindset as hamas there would be no more gaza they have more than enough fire power for that i think i would have stopped supporting israel a while ago if it weren t for hamas threatening to make

with hamas and hezbollah iran is a huge country israel can t go to war unless you expect us americans to die for your war let s put it this way if americans were to end up fighting in iran it would be due to a world war where iran is allied with russia north korea and china america would conduct air strikes on iran but no full scale invasion secondly i m an american and would support attacks against the iranian regime because of the threat it poses to my country', 'june israel preemptively attacks iran to destroy existential threat of iran nuclear program after iran nuclear talks are deadlocked this is not entirely correct israel s attack was wasn t actually preemtive iran attacked israel first in really it s been attacking israel indirectly for decades via proxies but that doesn t quite rise to the definition of an armed attack which would grant casus beli for a war of self defense but when iran attacked israel in its rocket salvo last year that most definitely did rise to a casus beli important to note here is that the attack by iran was a retaliation for the killing of an irgc general in syria who was there cooridinating the arming of hezbollah the fact the attack was not on iranian soil and that it conferred an immediate military benefit against an armed force israel was openly warring with makes this legally not a justification for an armed attack by iran against israel once iran has demonstrated that it is willing to directly attack israel it became strategically necessary to degrade its striking ability both israel and iran know that the way to beat israel is to saturate its superior but not unlimited defensive capability that mean manufacturing and stocking a volume of rockets that israel cannot logistically handle once that occurs israel s defensive advantage is nullified and iran s ability to threaten israel increases significantly israel has been aware of this but has not been able to afford preventing it directly because of the threat of a hezbollah counterstrike but once the threat of hezbollah was removed a strategic window opened for israel to hit iran before it could scale up beyond israel s capability to absorb the damage was expected to be significant but tolerable in a way that waiting for iran to choose the time to attack again would not be the nuclear aspect of this is the sexiest so it got a lot of attention but imo the most important achievement of the war against iran was hitting their missile manufacturing storage and launching infrastructure people does not constitute a genocide is an incorrectly correct statements people in srebenica constituted a genocide it s the common rebuttal and it s correct what it doesn t account for is how and why they died which is what actually constitutes genocide not the number the k bosniaks were not civilians killed while fighting an armed force even out of negligence that would be a war crime but not genocide instead they were killed while they were held in custody where they were systematically executed out of combat the was no military advantage to be gained from it the only explanation for why it happened is for the purpose of there existing fewer bosniaks that s what genocide is not the number game cont', 'is your position that israel shouldn t have attacked iran iran literally has a countdown clock in tehran to israel s destruction according to the israelis as if they ever needed a valid casus belli to launch their attacks they believe they own the place and can strike anyone anywhere which will make others wary of their ways and most likely hasten their demise they have been funding terrorist attacks against israel for decades and as if israel never supported any proxy forces anywhere now however they directly attacked a sovereign country by targeting their high officials on their own soil which should amount to a declaration of war which didn t came how do you suggest that israel is doing this because they merely think iran is a threat lol iran is literally the saving grace of israel whose tentacles prop up secterian militias everywhere not just against israel but also other sunni states which might otherwise form a more coherent anti israel coalition israel is literally shooting itself in the foot right now for bibi s amusement they will not emerge unscathed from this but iran is to be less trusted because they are not a democracy and israel is iran is not to be trusted not because they re not a democracy its because they re a secterian shi a state whose agents have been undermining muslim unity in the middle east since the safawid era going even before that as vassals of turkic powers ismaili shi a secterians have been instrumental in weakening muslim power and leaving us open to depredations by crusading

conclusion where the mullah regime aligns itself firmly with us and stops abusing the four righteous caliphs and all the sahaba why not we love the ahl al bayt as much as they do the highway out of tehran is jammed with people fleeing thanks israel send more refugees to europe the mossad has infiltrated iran and was able to execute many military leaders and nuclear scientists iran has done none of this you can simply google any of this maybe mossad should have spent more time inflitrating hamas and stop them from launching raids into their territory either they re unable or unwilling whichever it is simply shows to me that israel isn t as invincible as they claim to be you might say hey its the element of surprise i could say the same for this attack i never would have thought that israel would do something so brazenly in violation of international norms but they did like assasins killing their enemies in their sleep in their own homes the consequence of this war will be that for the first time in years iran will no longer be funding and training terror groups to slaughter israeli civilians no it will directly shoot missiles into israeli cities instead and these won t

and that likely includes deaths by natural causes i agree there s possibly more fog of war and all that but best available evidence is k and your argument that we don t know the true figure applies to every conflict hence nullifying it here for example to this day the number of civilans deaths caused by coaltion forces in the iraq war varies from k to k violent civilian deaths caused by the iraq war are estimated at closer to k the higher figures are based on the increased mortality rates from the collapse of the country and the violence caused by the resulting instability to compare with gaza we d have to calculate how many die over the next few years as a result of the bombing campaign massive amounts of asbestos spread everywhere unexploded munitions long term effects of disease starvation and dehydration later deaths from the tens of thousands of serious injuries sustained to date the homelessness inflicted on over a million people and everything else we don t know that figure yet i do think it should be compared to iraq in the regard but at the moment it isn t an equivalent comparison not true the un eu and other sources estimate that civilians usually account for percent to percent of casualties or a ratio in modern war though this does mix all types of wars if you go and look at the actual report it takes that from they re even using previous israeli palestinian conflicts as the source it s not here s a time when france destroyed an entire city with missiles and killed ten civilians for every militant and everyone applauded it s a collection of war crimes in the battle of mosul a battle supervised by the u s that used the world s most powerful airpower resources some civilians were killed compared to roughly isis terrorists the figures from mosul attributed about a third of the deaths to each side of the conflict and the remaining third undetermined the conservative estimate there would be none of that plausibly prooves genocidal intent and its dolus specialis standard no it doesn t which is why i said it isn t proven that some strikes may have been revenge based or reckless or intended to force population movements does not prove genocidal intent it would if enough of them were conducted for those purposes but we don t know and likely never will barring some major investigation along the lines of the review into the nato bombing campaign in yugoslavia that leaves us with the argument that israel haven t been proven to have committed genocide but those who claim it are speculating based on an at least somewhat plausible set of assumptions finally the obvious which is that israel is clearly fighting a just war given october th it has the right and perhaps even the oblgiation to remove hamas from power to nullify a clear and present and serious security threat fighting defensively justifies the decision to war it doesn t justify conduct in the war if ukraine had taken back all of their territory in a single day and then spent nine months bombing moscow and st petersburg into rubble while of the russian population was evacuated to siberia we wouldn t say that their conduct is beyond reproach because russia started it or because of bucha or because putin refuses to surrender we would rightly condemn any unnecessary killing or devastation imho the argument that israel is unduly targeting civilans just enough to have plausible deniability is pretty weak you could make that argument about any war and it s an argument purely based on plausibiltiy and not evidence i d say it s actually stronger here than in most recent examples we can see the considerable amount of open hatred and dehumanisation coming from the israeli populace and government some of which is so severe it clearly amounts to a call to genocide we know that a majority of the population would be willing to starve the civilian population of gaza to death by blocking all humanitarian aid we have tens of thousands of airstrikes on civilian structures without any clear information on who or what was targeted we have clear examples of idf soldiers killing people who posed no conceivable threat as with the surrendering israeli hostages we have a disregard for life so severe that it enables the use of human shields to check for mines and traps with the obvious implication being that the lives of those civilians are considered to lack value we have the prison and detention system that has become so brutal it has effectively implemented systematic abuse and torture despite the system itself later deigning at least a third of the detainees to have been civilians we also have a deliberate blanket policy of refusing access to journalists and of refusing neutral parties access to inspect prison facilities all of that combined it s not a stretch to speculate that israeli troops on the ground may well have committed genocide through random undisclosed and unjustified killings', 'notice that this number is the end figure and not the figures in the fog of war which are the numbers that we re seeing currently the point isn t that the numbers we see right now are accurate i pointed out that they aren t and that is to be expected the inconsistency is a product of the difficulty to report accurate information not necessarily that the numbers are faked the past accuracy of reporting lends some credence to the numbers being reported as accurately as currently possible and in good faith this is by no means definitive of course so we can corroborate the reported numbers with other data such as the number of destroyed buildings to get a larger picture another thing that s lacking from this is the crucial difference in who is a militant and who is not something that the numbers of the health ministry don t provide now and something that the estimates that they gave after previous wars were different than the un and israel s estimations as per the un s analysis of the conflict u n researchers start out with figures from the ministry the media and other sources but then cross check them with the help of palestinian israeli and international human rights groups the u n s overall number of killed is slightly higher than that of the gaza health ministry the u n said nearly percent of the total or were civilians defined as those who didn t take part in hostilities and were not members of armed groups source your point is sort of irrelevant when of those killed were determined to be civilians as per the un that being said determining whether someone was or was not a militant is difficult since it requires witness accounts or local community knowledge the current numbers we see indicate significant numbers of child and women casualties which are obviously not militants if we are killing children simply because hamas is using them as human shields i don t understand how that is in any way justifiable it would imply we know children will die before we drop the bomb and we don t care as long as we get a couple militants in the process besides even if it was true in the past it doesn t really answer op s analysis perhaps in this current conflict when the complete destruction of hamas is on the table it acts differently op s analysis is invalid there is no question to answer as another comment pointed out the variance in the numbers is more consistent with the data being batched and reported than being faked op basically just took the numbers at face value in a vacuum and concluded they are fake with no corroborating evidence context as usual is very important i am for the complete destruction of hamas i m not in favor of the complete destruction of gaza which is what is currently happening let s be generous and say that at the end of the conflict hamas is gone what is left for the civilians to return to the largest population center gaza city is essentially in ruins', 'the un is lying about of gaza deaths are women and children tldr summary the un picked some sample to make conclusions when there is a sample from the same source that shows the ratio of casualties that are women and children is i was highly surprised to see the recent spat of articles coming out like this supporting the un s claim that near of the gaza dead are women and children why because they are lying from the article the un s human rights office has condemned the high number of civilians killed in the war in gaza saying its analysis shows close to of verified victims over a six month period were women and children the un agency said it verified the details of people killed in gaza from november to april its analysis found around of verified victims were children and women remember the un uses numbers from the gaza health ministry fta gaza s hamas run health ministry whose figures the un sees as reliable notice they are basing this on counting details of deaths in a period between november and april however we already have many previously published sources even through the un about analysis of a much larger quantity of deaths take this article from may the u n humanitarian agency citing gaza s health ministry says children and women were killed in gaza as of april the u n says gaza s health ministry has been able to fully identify deaths out of more than people the ministry says have been killed in the gaza strip or this article with updated tracking through august the gaza ministry of health moh has released a new detailed list of gazans reportedly killed in the ongoing war since october marking a significant improvement in the accuracy and quality of casualty reporting the report covering deaths between october and august in terms of demographics the new list closely mirrors the april report of the deaths recorded are children under are adults between and and are elderly individuals over in these articles from may and october we can see the of deaths that are women and children is not near perspective i analyzed the moh numbers a month ago and estimated the civilian militant casualty ratio is to if we used the un s false numbers we would end up with a ratio of to those aren t close to each other the latter would be much more indicative of indiscriminate bombing than the former for reference if the number of women children was of the casualties the ratio would be near to which would be in line with most wars that are not even in such a dense urban environment what is the un doing i have no idea did they cherry pick this sample from the that have been accounted for in a way to make the numbers look worse is this an

petitioning for the us government to spend less on the weapons they send to israel means that israel ends up with more dumb bombs which cause more civilian casualties for example the mk bombs cost k k if they re unguided aka dumb bombs and k k if they re guided which improves the accuracy and reduces civilian casualties estimates are that up to of bombs dropped on gaza may have been dumb bombs if you gave them more money and let them shop for whatever they want they could just purchase more dumb bombs rather than replace the dumb bombs with smart bombs with the extra cash no it would be better to just to stop supplying them dumb bombs altogether complete ban', 'why are people critical of israel so prone to speaking in hyperbole from the associated press the pound bomb has multiple variants some are designed to penetrate deep underground targets while others detonate above ground and cause widespread damage depending on the variant and whether the munition is dropped in an open or urban area its blast radius can be as far as a quarter mile away or a much more confined area the bombs are dumb or unguided bombs but can be turned into more precise weapons with the addition of joint direct attack munition kits or jdam kits which add a tail fin and navigation that added kit enables troops to guide the munition to a target rather than simply dropping it from a fighter jet onto the ground the kits make the weapons more precise but in a densely populated urban environment a jdam kit is not going to make much of a difference a precise hit will still have the reach to kill unintended bystanders according to cnn the us has provided more bombs than jdams and almost half of detonations were assessed as unguided furthermore the idf has used white phosphorous and lied about it so it s clear that they re a willing to use ordinance irresponsibly and b try to cover it up so there s some ambiguity but it s possible that the largest bombs are consistently equipped with guidance systems in the absence of irrefutable proof i should ve said that israel is dropping both pound bombs and unguided bombs my mistake but still not a great look for the idf where did you get those ratios they were widely reported would they take solace in the fact that their own government sacrificed their parents as human shields and called them martyrs what do you think does it look like palestinians are exclusively blaming hamas personally i think the idf exaggerates this claim but with regards to operation swords of iron s effectiveness it doesn t really matter if the idf is creating more terrorists than it neutralizes this whole thing is pointless', 'everyone is involved but that in no way takes the responsibility off of israel for their actions or absolves them of their war crimes we are talking about people not numbers but if you are looking for numbers to put things into context here goes over of infrastructure including people s houses have been bombed and destroyed over bombs have been dropped on palestinians in months this is unheard of in basically any war more civilians have been killed in eight weeks most of them women and children than during the year war in afghanistan million people have been cut off of food water and medicine israel keeps bragging about how they send out warnings well those warnings don t matter when they ve turned the area they warned civilians to go into a war zone now you might say yes but then they warned civilians to go to a new area well what good does that do if israel has cut off all fuel if these people have no gas for their cars and run the risk of being bombed by israel on their drive there is nowhere safe in the country so where does israel expect them to go saying this war has a lot of interference of course it does the us government is heavily involved with israel and is bank rolling the war to have eyes and an ally in the middle east and also largely due to the heavy presence of israeli lobbying in the us government don t think this is the case have a look at what portion of jewish population make up the cabinet as for further interference for sure many muslim countries are picking their sides other countries are piggybacking and choosing their allies that being said the decisions made on how to wage war and the war crimes they chose to commit in retaliation to october are fully on israel unless we think that russia china or the us dropped the bombs instead of israel that russia and the us decided to ignore a warning they had of an attack a year in advance and take hours to respond when it takes an ho it to fly across the whole country decided to shoot unarmed palestinian kids and women execution style in a un school decided to cut off two million people from food and water decided to allow settler violence to run rampant in the west bank did the us and russia do these things or did the country whose own democratically voted in government controls their army and

rigid take vietnam again the protests weren t just about being at war they were about the scale of destruction and the moral justification or lack thereof same with south african apartheid the u s wasn t directly involved militarily but the divestment protests here were huge and sustained focused on human rights and injustice not because of who the ruling party was i believe what tends to spark large protest movements like this isn t simply who s involved but how visible the suffering is how emotionally immediate the images are and how much perceived moral complicity there is from the u s government gaza checks all those boxes especially for younger generations raised on real time graphic social media coverage to reduce it all down to it only happens when jews are involved assumes people are more motivated by hate than by empathy that s not only a bleak view of humanity it also ignores that the vast majority of protest signs chants and demands are about palestinian suffering not antisemitic messaging yes some antisemitism exists within the margins of these protests as it has in almost every broad movement throughout history and i know some protestors especially young ones lean towards edginess and will participate in hate for shock value but equating the entire protest movement to that fringe is like saying the civil rights movement was invalid because some people in the crowd held extreme views ultimately i believe people protest when they feel something when there s a visible injustice a sense of urgency and when they believe their country s policies are

and just like all the big anti israeli protests get attention so would other big protests big protests a lot of people who care about the topic and make a lot of noise more awareness by and for everyone literally tens of thousands present company included protested against iran outside of iran so your way of showing other countries get a lot of attention is a protest from years ago where only k participated and just a reminder there are k people from iranian decent living in canada as canada is the rd country with the most iranians in it after iran the us so it wouldn t be unlikely that most of the people in this protest were iranians k k so even if participated it would still be the majority of the people there let s take things into perspective shall we in nov only a month after the th of october happened already people people participated in anti israel protest despite the fact the war only started and if that would happened to any other country the people would have protested in favor of it not against it then you ve got the red line protests in the netherlands in the first one that happened on may people joined the next one in june got then we got the in australia from this month smaller ones that still included tens of thousands against israel happened in germany france after days to the war those examples of course are only from europe as the biggest protests obviously happened in the muslim world with the biggest one happening in bangladesh contained between k to m people so i m sorry but one single protest that happened years ago contained mostly iranians involved tens of thousands there s no real comparison here your argument is so poor it doesn t even deserve a further response like i mentioned earlier insults wouldn t get you anywhere it makes people s arguments look weaker not stronger', 'i m not moving the goalposts my original comment was about why people care about the war in gaza and about all pro palestinians as characterised by the op my point above about college protests was about college protests which issues people care about and what actions they take in response are two different questions people can care deeply about issues but not physically protest over them people typically protest over issues that are in the hands of domestic politicians or other elected representatives they do so to convince their representatives that a large constituency cares about this issue and would like to see action nobody is protesting the uighur genocide or sudan on us college campuses or in washington or london because nobody there can do anything about it hence the point about money and support if there are people with influence over money and support they are possible targets to influence through protest if there aren t protest is pointless and potentially even harmful but the reaction among the public hoewever horrified by russias actions never devolved into what the anti israel protests devolved into even though the russia ukraine war is much clearer where it concerns morality than the israel palestine war again why would you expect protests when nobody in western countries has any influence over russia russia is already sanctioned to the maximal extent possible western politicians are literally sending billions of dollars of arms to ukraine short of sending the us military to fight russia directly what would be the point of protests look at recent major protests blm climate change occupy abortion rights israel gaza it s always about things that the people being protested can change putin doesn t care about placards in washington dc yet and j repeat myself it is the conflict that the only jewish state in the world involves that apparently elicits such a strong violent ideological and emotional response among the public even to the point of denial of israels right to exist being uncontroversial in broadening circles this is a different point us military and financial aid to israel is a legitimate target for protest within the us collegiate investments in certain industries or countries are a legitimate target for collegiate organisation you might remember the fossil fuel protests and occupy movement which were far more violent than any pro palestinian protests you seem to be saying that it is wrong for the us electorate to express its views

take out hezbollah without occupying lebanon long term we are talking about years hezbollah has long rang missiles than it did in the past so it means israel has to occupying more of lebanon', 'you make a fair point but actually it did it wanted to colonize a greater israel and that s why it attacked where is the evidence for this israel attacked specific sections of lebanon where iran s proxy hezbollah was entrenched and demanded one thing adherence to the agreement that would keep them north of te litani river that it nothing more nothing less do what you are contractually obligated to do arab all grandstanding don t you realize how the jews operate how jews operate we demand you adhere to the peace agreement we made together how arabs operate of course we will meanwhile smuggling ammunition and weapons into demilitarized zones then attacking israel for months on end before the so called filthy zionist rats finally put their foot down and fight back hassan nasrallah knew that israel was attempting to invade anyway so he gave them a free pass to invade or hoped to mire them in a multi front war they couldn t keep going for long enough to win we have to stand with our brothers in palestine ah so you re a muslim lebanese doesn t count you re an occupier and you are currently practicing taqiyya ancient history sure you muslims bring up when it plays into your argument but the s are ancient history that no lon ger matters got it more taqiyya but they stopped the israeli advance into lebanon no israel always openly said it needed to secure the area south of the litani they had no intention of further escalating or doing anything other than forcing hezbollah to honor the un agreement you really trust the jews very much you really think they didn t want to invade they were just cowardly and didnt want to commit their soldiers to a certain death yes we trust the jews even though israel is a secular state and many arabs are in high positions in the army and government there the jews unlike some other groups in that region keep their promises that s why the us is an ally meanwhile iran russia n korea none of these countries keep their promioses and therefore the usa doesn t ally with them it is pretty simple really my point is that islamic jihadism like any form of religious extremism believes that it is committing a theologically divine purpose when it fails there is a great amount of cognitive dissonance created in the mind of the dogmatic you re pretty dogmatic about the jews you seem to think that jews are somehow less trustworthy than christians muslims or others where is your proof for this shockingly racist dogma the above conversation is one i have had many times with hezbollah apologists and supporters to you it seems too ridiculous and you probably blame me for wasting your time and mine explaining how the brain of a dogmatic operates but to be fair to me you did ask interesting how give the islamic dogma a pass whilst claiming that jews adhere to a dogma that jews actually don t have there s nothing in judaism that requires a jewish state to go any further north than it already is but besides that israel is a secular jewish state that does not adhere to any jewish dogma if it did homosexuality would be illegal shabbat would be imposed by law the beit hamikdash would be rebuilt all mosques and churches destroyed etc none of that has happened in israel', 'my friend hezbollah supporters were celebrating in the street after the war was concluded in lebanon because they believed they won the reason they believed they won is because israel did not invade lebanon but israel did not want to invade lebanon you make a fair point but actually it did it wanted to colonize a greater israel and that s why it attacked but it hadn t attacked for years and offered peace to lebanon several times the lebanese flag lit up tel aviv city hall after a port explosion all grandstanding don t you realize how the jews operate ok but hezbollah attacked with rockets israel told it for months to stop without invading and hezbollah refused isn t that provocation that was not israel s fault hassan nasrallah knew that israel was attempting to invade anyway ok but then why is it then when told to leave this alone by every lebanese sect he refused and said that the rockets would not stop unless gaza was left alone we have to stand with our brothers in palestine the same ones that massacred you so often in the s that your parents threw rice at israel when it entered lebanon ancient history ok but if netanyahu unequivocally stated that the objective was only to stop the rockets and hassan nasrallah guaranteed they would never stop no matter what unless gaza was left alone that would imply whoever broke their word lost right whoever was forced to do what they stated they would never do that seems logical well hezbollah stopped firing rockets and nasrallah died but they stopped the israeli advance into lebanon but you just said you really trust the jews very much you really think they didn t want to invade they were just cowardly and didnt want to commit their soldiers to a certain death my point is that islamic jihadism like any form of religious extremism believes that it is committing a theologically divine purpose when it fails there is a great amount of cognitive dissonance created

would have heard by now if israel had intelligence on any unrwa members in the past and unrwa refused to act of course this did not happened israel didnt gave any reply to unrwa that s israels choice is it israeli intelligence job to help unrwa to do their job to know who they are hiring israel is the occupier and it has a very advanced intelligence capabilities if it s going to kick up a fuss about a miniscule amount of staff then maybe it would have been more honest for it to clearly state that it had a list of unrwa staff already you can t expect a humanitarian agency to have the same intelligence abilities as a military super power who occupy and oppress the people if israel was unaware of these alleged links then there s no way unrwa could know we shouldn t lose sight of why we have and need unrwa and israels actions play a big part in why we need unrwa but the better question is the one you ignored i m sure there are many more idf members committing war crimes currently so it s rather odd to concentrate on a humanitarian agency and point to allegations concerning a mere people', 'it s not reported it s not acknowledged by international aid law orgs like the un partly because of advocacy for palestinians antisemitism against israel partly for strategic reasons qatar which is a big backer of us studies of israel palestine scholarship academic programs also the owner of al jazeera has been stealth funding hamas also hosts the billionaire hamas leaders who amassed this wealth wealthy mideast muslim interests fund palestinian charities as well so there s a conflict of interest in the local reporting as well as academic aid org law org news coverage of the region with these conflicts there s no reason for academics aid law orgs regional news etc not ignore unrwa s transgressions another corrupting factor is that unrwa has a vast amount of staff compared to other united nations refugee charters i forget the exact numbers now but i believe it makes up most of the united nations employment base as the palestinian population continues to explode so does the number of unrwa staff grow and therefore the size of the un s budget itself so an unresolved growing palestinian problem directly feeds the un s growth so unrwa employees executives more or less run the un now as the elephant in the organization rather than the un having good oversight good management of unrwa importantly palestinians do get personal benefits from all this cashflow they have free schooling health care housing food etc it s not as if they are totally deprived of benefit under this system the corrupt cashflow exists above beyond what they can demand on a humanitarian basis even low status palestinian families have better education health care etc than the average low status arab in arab countries so palestinians do benefit in this system there s like an entire united nations international aid law edifice that feeds off palestinians problems continuing to exist its population steadily growing year after year if the palestinian problems were suddenly solved this entire system of graft un bloat would crash if individual palestinians are getting free food shelter health care education infrastructure aid and don t want to end unrwa why would anyone in the system of graft that feeds off unresolved palestinian refugee problems want to cut that off ultimately the important question is what helps palestinians my feeling is that in prolonging their refugee status indefinitely disrupting their economic self governing activity in corrupting the leadership with their lack of transparency accountability for literally billions of dollars a year unrwa does palestinians more harm than they should there is an israeli staffed org called un watch they ve been

including smuggling arms in un ambulances and hosting meetings of tanzim in un buildings on august the idf accused hamas of stealing three ambulances that had just been transferred through israel to the unrwa the unrwa spokesman denied the claim a week later hamas confirmed it confiscated the ambulances due to bureaucratic reasons a unrwa spokesman also confirmed this but soon retracted this admission and denied the incident even publicizing a photo it claimed was of one its officials with the ambulances during the israel hamas war one of the hostages said after having been freed that he had been held in a house of a unrwa teacher a hostage released during the israel hamas ceasefire who was held for nearly days in gaza disclosed that he was held captive in an attic of an unrwa teacher

think you can accomplish furthermore war leads to death there has never been a clean war where civilian casualties didn t happen war is hell what i find intriguing is why everyone s paying attention

casualties once it happens to country they associate with protesting a foreign war in the u s is not going to have as great of an effect as they think it is and that goes for posting things on social

this while legitimate criticism of israeli government policies is not antisemitism jewish students are not the israeli government so harassing jewish students and blaming them for israel s actions is of course antisemitism one response denied it was even happening and asked for proof one response played oppression olympics and said what s happening in gaza is worse so therefore jewish students should be grateful they re only being harassed and not bombed that s a horrendous reply and clearly imposes some sort of collective guilt on jewish students we would not accept this rhetoric aimed at muslim students after isis commits a terrorist attack but for some reason people think it s ok with diaspora jews it is not but it s been normalised too much recently as if people have pushed the envelope as far as possible to test the limits of this sort of language pushback is badly needed one response basically used token asajews and said since jews are in the protests it can t be antisemitism those people seem to think it can only be antisemitism if of jews are offended by it the comment section was atrocious even apart from that people just do not want to believe antisemitic harassment of jewish students is happening and if they do they don t care or even victim blame jews or even accuse them of distracting people from genocide tm on behalf of the israeli government and

the other person that jews are a people they aren t all white no mizrahis are not arab judaism is an ethnoreligion yes judaism predates islam no the people in the old testament were not muslim most jews are zionists again jews are an ethnoreligion no those few hasidics you see online chanting death to israel are not a majority and are in fact nuts etc it has come to a point where it s not even discussing the war it s discussing if jewish people are a people or if they are considered human beings our president issued a statement outlining the events a day after oct th giving his condolences to both the jewish community and all people affected including palestinians in the student bds referendum months later the muslim student association said that this actively harmed palestinian students which firmly solidifies many of their beliefs that seeing jews as human is somehow harmful to muslims and palestinians i lost a friend a while ago she posted something online publicly that said the only place jews are indigenous to is jahannam islamic hell lot to unpack there but yeah i heard she got a serious reprimand at her consulting job and doesn t post like that anymore i didn t even want her to lose her job i didn t want her to face discipline both because i believe in free speech i still wish her well and also because she probably just thinks the zionist controlled media and a zionist controlled consulting company are censoring her and they re evil and they re controlling her and so on probably solidifying her beliefs more i just wanted her to see my people as people if you have read this long i just want you to know i m not even asking you to engage in israel palestine discourse or to even listen to israel s side i am asking you to stop hating jews at your school to acknowledge their right to exist to acknowledge they are a people an ethnicity a religion a culture that is thousands of years old wrapped up in one you don t have to like us just please stop chanting for our deaths before you say or post something that will get thousands of likes on social media about how a jewish person is ugly or how they stink or how a fellow jewish student of yours should die because they re a colonizing racist nazi or you feel hatred of jewish students who aren t jvp gathering for a holiday please quell the hatred in your heart end of this spiel i guess hope the rutgers students are okay and for the people who are speaking up for palestinians while holding room in their heart for jews and israelis thank you', 'this inflammatory post centered around a persecution fetish is giving off vibes like this lol columbia university has descended into chaos not really students have peacefully demonstrated outside by doing sit ins and encampments the only thing resembling chaos here were columbia students getting suspended expelled and subsequently getting arrested for trespassing on their campus after the president of the university called the cops on them this seems to be the case as ilhan omar s daughter who attended columbia was also arrested on those charges for protesting on campus after being suspended it s a dirty trick and one you left out of your post in order to paint the protestors as criminals given that columbia university is a private university and anti israel protests frequently turn violent not really i m sure you can cherry pick a few instances of violence at these protests while removing the context behind them like the alleged instances of violence mentioned in the article but this encampment seems to be a broadly peaceful movement uh huh telling jews to go back to poland is not free inquiry rioting vandalism trespassing and limiting the movement of others are not considered free speech instead of giving some nuance to the protestors you lump them all in as violators of the law who are not innocently expressing their right to free speech but are in your imagination targeting jews specifically and harassing them based on their ethnic background go back to poland a mob surrounding jews and calling them genocidal freaks it is right to rebel hamas give them hell settlers settlers go back home palestine is ours alone al qasam s next targets now look through those links and try thinking about whether or not maybe there is more to the story than the evil protestors harassing innocent jews because of their ethnic background when jewish students are holding seder at the encampment funny is that if you at least showed an ounce of this sorrow for people being murdered or when the jewish voice for peace and students for justice in palestine were banned by columbia or when columbia students were sprayed by former idf soldiers with a chemical substance i would be taking your concerns about slogans praising al qassam more seriously though it doesn t even look like that was at columbia but definitely in nyc frankly i am skeptical of the claims and videos used to demonize the protestors not just because they ignore the overwhelming majority of protestors but things like the woman talking about al qassam s next targets could quite easily be a character in a pro israeli demonstration trying to get their point across see it should go without saying that this jews apparently do not count as a minority who are targets of hateful ideology it s ok to break the law against objectionable speakers the protestors in both cases are believed to be fighting back against bigotry the only times that columbia professors and students as well as academia in general care about free speech is when it s used to bash israel and conservatives there is a distinction between inviting a speaker to campus who will follow the law and harassment if the speaker s views are objectionable most of all columbia university does not understand what free speech is is a faulty conclusion']"

yes it continued through the withdrawal it ended though what you ommited by not linking your timeline is that comes from the entry for september and there are more entries for that year it sure reads like the un is stating the occupation continued in past the withdrawal because of the continued blockade but then the blockade ended november agreement on movement and access ama signed by israel and the palestinian authority pa stipulates that rafah and all other crossing points to gaza operate continuously and that israel allow the movement of goods and persons between the west bank and gaza november rafah terminal with egypt opens to select passengers under ama the european union eu border assistance mission bam supervises border control if a blockade alone constitutes an occupation that

criticism that egypt receives due to their handling of the border from pro palestinians that when we bring up ending the blockade it includes egypt s part in it it can be assumed that when we advocate for ending the blockade it includes opening up the border with egypt which israel controls at this point from the gazan side if you re asking for times since the start of the war that we have put blame on egypt specifically for their handling of the border i don t know any because we instead focus on the entirety of the blockade not just egypt s part these links were supposed to help show this since the start of the war i ve seen plenty of people advocate for an end to the blockade whether it be online in speeches or the couple of protests that i ve been to if you re asking about specifically advocating for egypt to end it why would we do that we can just advocate for ending the entire blockade when israel is primarily responsible for the blockade or when we can advocate for ending the genocide or for countries to stop sending israel weapons additionally since you seem to think that people who are pro palestine are disingenuous in our care there are plenty of fundraisers for raising money to help individual gazans get out or for raising money for relief additionally i ll note that about gazans have already left via egypt', 'frankly i do not want to get engage in

years before the israeli withdrawal and hamas took control as early as during the second intifada israel had blockaded the gaza strip from wiki if you want the already condensed information during the second intifada israel blockaded the palestinian territories including the gaza strip several times in gaza the blockade caused unemployment to skyrocket to christian aid reported that malnourishment among children doubled in one year due to the blockade clinics run by middle east council of churches also reported treating increasing numbers of underweight and malnourished children the blockade in wasn t just because of the result of hamas attacks but stretched far earlier than even hamas taking power and the israeli withdrawal in hamas wasn t even a major power or threat yet second israel and the us were alleged to have supported fatah against hamas and supplied weapons and information in a bid to overthrow hamas basically a military coup which the us has a long tradition of doing the us trained fatah soldiers in anti terror attacks and lifting supplies and weapons to the presidential guard of palestine who were filled with loyal fatah soldiers and sent cia aid to mohammad dahlan the main fatah opponent against hamas from hamas perspective they launched a pre emptive strike something israel has also used to justify a lot of their actions against fatah to stop the coup from even materializing in the first place thus the rest of their military actions from their viewpoint like rocket attacks and wars against israel is a deterrent action against another possible israeli and us coup and as payback for what the us and israel tried to do in certainly any other country in the world if they found out their neighbor next door tried and failed to militarily overthrow them in a coup and supported their enemies would expect payback and revenge which the us has done numerous times by sanctioning invading and overthrowing their enemies for a hostile action that threatened their sovereignty i ll post some links and sources below from wiki again on this the pro fatah view is that it was a plain military coup by hamas the pro hamas view is that the us drew up a plan to arm fatah cadres with the aim of forcefully removing hamas from power in gaza according to the pro hamas view fatah fighters led by commander mohammed dahlan with logistical support from the us central intelligence agency were planning to carry out a bloody coup against hamas then hamas pre emptively took control over gaza some news outlets and sources that purport to show us and israeli

israel additionally its not ceding control its ending an illegitimate occupation yes they didnt like that idea despite the fact that legally it was mandatory no what the right of return is is exactly what it says the right of refugees to return home the entire reason the refugees exist is that israel ethnically cleansed them back then when israel attempted to join the un they were told that they would be required to implement all resolutions including the already passed ones like and in particular were promised to let the refugees return israel made that promise they were let into the un and immediately said yeah were not going to do that tough luck in hindsight the world should ve sanctioned them to hell until they let them return or used military force if need be but alas we were all a bit busy with the cold war brewing of course now they cant all return it sucks because its functionally rewarding israel for ethnically cleansing of its arab population and then illegaly preventing their return but you cant punish the israeli of today for crimes they did not commit however that does not mean the right of return isnt legitimate it just means that some will return and most will be

fled or were strongly advised by the attacking arab armies to leave to return after israel was annihilated most of the palestinians in both gaza and the west bank are refugees whose family was expelled from what became israel therefore they have the desire to return back to their ancestral home it s not that complicated they were refugees of a war they started and apparently it is quite complicated because no one is a refugee years later without being resettled no one inherits refugee status no one is entitled to return as a hostile enemy of the host country no one returns but also gets their own separate state these are made up rules that only apply to the palestinians in opposition to israel the british and french shouldn t have carved up the middle east but they did funny how

less value if the jews all came from yemen or iraq would it be ok why should the jews who lived there be obligated to submit to some newly created muslim ruler you are losing the plot this is about

care about the west bank when jordan controlled it or egypt controlling gaza there s your good answer it s not about land', 'no there is no timer in the law except when someone is no longer a refugee the fact that palestinians get to be forever refugees no matter how many generations are born on the same land shows the special treatment they get by the un other refugees either go back to where they came from or resettle they don t perpetually get to be refugees no they couldn t a basic principle of all laws is that they are not retroactive these laws did not exist thousands of years ago i m

universal truth yes they get either the right to return or if they prefer compensation this is a key reason why germany agreed a reparations agreement with israel following the war it specifically called out that a key component of this was for resettling refugees this would never happen and you know it your honest to god opinion is that hundreds of thousands of jews should be allowed to return to countries they and their ancenstors we re cleansed from or be paid by those countries really germany were only forced to do this because they literally lost ww no chance anyone would willingly pay reparations to jews living in israel let alone let them back into the country and allow them to live there safely this is a pipe dream just like the palestinians wanting to return to israel

violations i m not ignoring it i think the removals have discriminatory intent and the whole settlement argument is a cover i also don t think non discriminatory intent grants one license to commit crimes against humanity which is where we disagree i advocate for the expulsion of the people living in illegal settlements purely due to such settlements being in violation of international law and do not support the killing or genocide of such people expulsion is killing you bomb rape burn down homes murder until they leave that s how it is done and before you go to the idf no the idf can t do the settlers rd of the officer core are settlers something like and likely an even higher percentage of idf deeply disagree with the un s position if the knesset ordered it which they won t do there would be a coup not a removal of the settlers they get removed they get removed by a foreign army which has to do it against idf opposition you are talking about the death of millions here in practice but in theory let s say just the death of say k to terrorize the other k into leaving', 'accusing israel of ethnic cleansing is quite ironic it s a spurious accusation and an absurd one no matter how common it is on the internet ironically israel is the only country in the region that did not systematically expel ethnic and religious minorities from its territory whether during war or in peacetime just in the levant in the th century alone the jews were originally ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in both gaza and hebron in almost years before israel declared independence and almost years before the first settlement in the wb not to mention the ethnic cleaning of virtually all jews from syria lebanon and the kingdom of jordan in the middle of the th century according to red cross and unrwa records over jews were ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in the wb including east jerusalem in when the arab legion invaded and jordan illegally occupied the territory for almost years even the jewish quarter of the old city of jerusalem was cleared of all jews and demolished in when it was captured by the arab legion and renamed arab east jerusalem that divided jerusalem until jordan forfeited its west bank in after losing another gratuitous war of conquest against israel on the other hand israel did not systematically expel arabs from its territory in fact the israeli declaration of independence specifically invites arabs within its sovereign borders to remain as israeli citizens and help to build the new country together many arabs did which is why over of israeli citizens are non jewish arabs with equal citizenship rights there were plenty of members of many arab ethnic groups and minority religions like the druze and beduins who fought alongside israel against the invading arab legion in and were proud to do so compare the multiculturalism and secularism of israel with the territories under the control of hamas and the pa that remain completely judenrein since at least it s quite a contrast the fact is that despite being the jewish state israel is the only secular country in the region where religious and ethnic minorities have equal citizenship rights and freedoms and where women and gays also have equal rights you will never see a gay pride parade in either gaza or ramallah for example almost of israeli citizens are muslim arabs and even more are christians druze beduins zoroastrians and bah s religions and ethnicities that face discrimination and oppression in the surrounding ethno centric arab and islamic countries but have found refuge in israel the bah faith s international headquarters for example known as the bah world centre is located in the northern city of haifa in israel unlike the situation in the territories under palestinian rule all israeli citizens both men and women have equal rights and freedoms regardless of religion ethnicity sexual orientation or national origin a situation not found in any of the other countries in the region arab muslims serve in the israeli parliament for example muslims serve as commanders in the idf there is even an arab muslim justice on israel s supreme court and he s not the first religious and ethnic minorities just do not have the same rights and freedoms in any of the other countries in the region like they have in israel the irony is that jews do not serve in the palestinian government or in the governments of any of the other countries of the muslim world precisely because they were gratuitously and systematically ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in those countries in the middle of the last century almost a million jews were gratuitously expelled from their ancient communities in all the countries of the muslim world from morocco east through egypt and yemen north through syria and lebanon all the way through iraq and iran a century ago for example the population of baghdad was a third jewish they were jews living in their own ancient communities in iraq that predated the invention of islam and the arrival of the arabs by a thousand years ironically most israeli jews today are not ashkenazi jews from europe as many people on the internet seem to believe but are in fact the descendants of those refugees expelled from the arab and muslim world they re sephardic and mizrahi jews and babylonian jews expelled from iraq and persian jews from iran', 'on the topic of gradual genocide gaza s population has only gone up over the last years this fact alone challenges the idea that they have been experiencing a genocide over this timeframe to call this a genocide would go against the definition itself and would open the doors to the loss of meaning of the word genocide itself which would make future designation of the term in other conflicts more difficult this would have negative consequences on the implementation of international law and would reduce the validity of the term itself with regards to ethnic cleansing i can see that this is something the far right israeli government is pushing for however ethnic cleansing is not genocide i am absolutely against ethnic cleansing of course and i oppose this policy completely what muddies the water on this topic though is the definition of ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic racial or religious groups from a given area with the intent of making the society ethnically homogeneous unlike the definition of genocide the term ethnic cleansing does not include national groups the palestinian identity at its core is a national identity not ethnic consider the fact that ethnically palestinians are the same as jordanians and israeli arabs after all they were part of the same country prior to i e the british mandate of palestine it is only in recent years that they have been considered a distinct group based on a shared nationalist cause please note that i am not trying to justify the removal of palestinians from gaza here i am only trying to use accurate terms which is what the whole aim of my post is in essence i would not say that genocide needs a new name but in this case i think the usage of the term ethnic cleansing needs a new name instead i am saying this from a scholarly perspective and i am not trying to make a moral or political commentary on the situation in gaza but rather i am calling into question the very language we use to accurately describe what is going on morally my stance on the situation in gaza is that people who want to leave should be able to and those who wish to stay should also be able to israel should not force either outcome on people in gaza and the gazan s should have the agency to decide on their fate israel should introduce more provisions to prevent forced expulsion such as resuming the flow of aid and the pursuit of a political resolution to the conflict such as the implementation of a new governing body in gaza with the help of the international community and local leaders who oppose hamas this is not something that can be achieved until hamas has been dismantled however']"

because hate is a faith at the outset he has chosen to devaluate words and reasons how entirely at ease he feels as a result how futile and frivolous discussions about the rights of the jew appear to him he has placed himself on other ground from the beginning if out of courtesy he consents for a moment to defend his point of view he lends himself but does not give himself he tries simply to project his intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse i mentioned awhile back some remarks by anti semites all of them absurd i hate jews because they make servants insubordinate because a jewish furrier robbed me etc never believe that anti semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies they know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge but they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words the anti semites have the right to play they even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors they delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert if you press them too closely they will abruptly fall silent loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past it is not that they are afraid of being convinced they fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side jean paul sartre anti semite and jew p', 'it s the great irony of modern race conscious liberalism they learned about internalized racism and sexism their ideology came to normalize the idea that racism doesn t only mean guys in white hoods but means your many small ingrained biases etc they rightly warn that the modern more equal society doesn t mean that racism is gone that it s just more subtle now a black president doesn t mean racism is over etc but then they failed to turn that lens on themselves in the case of antisemitism most of these people don t hate jews in the way that they understand most modern people aren t putting on white hoods and burning crosses but they re still antisemitic because even if they re atheist leaning they re ultimately the products of a western christian civilization that was at its core deeply antisemitic it came up the other day with a guy who was ranting about the star of david on israel s flag of course disregarding the plethora of countries including all those best most liberal northern european ones with crosses on their own flags they view a jewish symbol is aggressive and about religious theocracy a christian symbol is just a normal aspect of culture and this is probably true of most white people there s also just the basic cognitive dissonance and paradox of tolerance stuff these people want to be the most tolerant people in the world that s their identity but it faces an irresolvable test when they run into islam which they see as a minority brown people religion despite being a quarter of the world population but which is fundamentally intolerant not just of jews but of everyone in the end they fall into the normal patterns they accuse others of siding with the majority minority if you will we have to throw one of the two of these under the bus to square our beliefs and there s not that many jews and they re weird and we re socially antisemitic christians so let s do that the interesting thing is when it comes out into plain view and the punch a n zi liberals suddenly find themselves marching next to swastikas and suddenly seem unbothered by it hmm', 'most of the people who hate jewish people tend to hate other ethnic groups especially black people most antisemites don t hate jews per se antisemitism works differently from other kinds of racial hatred and is not straightforward i find sartre s anti semite and jew to be a very insightful essay into the matter he writes that the antisemite attributes all or part of his own misfortunes and those of his country to the presence of jewish elements in the community and proposes to remedy this by depriving jews of certain rights by expelling them or exterminating them sartre also finds that the antisemite is a prime example of a person who has entered into bad faith to avoid responsibility antisemitism is a way of feeling good proud even rather than guilty at the abandonment of responsibility antisemitism is a construct of a mutually exclusive concepts and jews are simultaneously semites non whites to the antisemite of the right and white to the one on the left communists to the right and capitalists to the left effeminate and weak to the neo nazi and strong ultra aggressive to the tankie etc whatever discontent one has with their society it is eventually found to have been caused by the jews jews brought the black plague jews caused the economic downfall of the weimar republic jews caused the bolshevik revolution jews oppressed the proletariat and threatened socialism etc this is a thousand year old tradition that has not disappeared every social crisis inevitably results in discovery of jewish culpability when american policemen shoot unarmed black men we discover the jews are truly culpable contrary to all evidence some activist says israel trained american police to use choking techniques therefore it must be true israel killed george floyd israel made american police use stop and frisk techniques too israel is culpable for american police brutality and jews who have never been seen as white by those for whom being white is a virtue are now seen as hyper white by those for whom whiteness is an unmitigated problem most antisemites don t realise they are antisemites and would swear on their lives they don t hate jews they are simply outraged at a social injustice that is inflicted by the jews when sending jews to the gas chambers germans sincerely believed they were serving social justice for the societal and economic downfall the jews inflicted on them these sentiments are now shifted to the jewish state the primary obstacle to world peace is israel the left has a very serious problem with antisemitism that stems from the influence of soviet political thought and propaganda and to be clear soviet antisemitism was influenced by nazi ideology which was influenced by the protocols making the far left and right the two sides of the same coin the modern far left would never admit how strongly influenced it is by the fsu but it will scream anti zionist slogans invented by kichko the fsu s ideological goebbels and later ivanov when accused of antisemitism the soviets replied zionist lies antisemitism is antithetical to socialism this is why the modern woke left will never scrutinise its fundamental concepts for antisemitism to do so is to destroy their whole worldview this is also why they are hyperaware of all kinds of structural oppression racism ableism sexism heteronormativity islamophobia etc but antisemitism is conspicuously absent from the discourse they want to believe a year old systemic problem disappeared in and could only be the fault of the far right critical race theory itself has an ideological jewish problem but to admit it is to destroy the worldview tldr anti semitism is an unsolvable problem sorry for the long post i am too verbose

justified by its preceding event i am a therapist who has dedicated his career to working with trauma and i have seen these cycles of escalations writ small but still devastating in the lives of many individuals and families people who are hurt people who hurt others because they are hurting people who hurt others because they are afraid of being hurt themselves i hear the echos of pain and hurt throughout generations like ghosts that feed off of pain to grow stronger the first thing you learn in doing trauma work is that separating out victims and perpetrators is often a messy proposition and one that shifts depending on what time or what relationship you are focusing on in any given session people are often both sometimes even simultaneously if you go into trauma work looking to find heroes and villains you will find more than you ever thought possible and none at all the second thing you learn is that you cannot wait for the pain to lessen before the healing can begin the pain lessens because the healing begins the third thing you learn is that healing is not a passive experience it is often a courageous and defiant act against what the body and mind has learned is fundamentally necessary to keep themselves safe trauma tells truths about the dangers of the world but lies about the roads that travel from and through them it divides people relationships and experiences into rigid binaries of strength and weakness safety and vulnerability winners and losers fighters and victims trauma tells you that the only way to make it through the fire is to run faster fight harder and smash obstacles or set controlled burns ahead of you so the fire is always in your sight and never coming up from behind to heal means forgoing all that not listening to that damaged part of your psyche no matter how convinced it is that the fire is going to engulf you the moment you deviate from what it knows is the only way to keep you safe and fourth and perhaps most challenging at least for me lesson learned in trauma work is that true justice can be a lighthouse to steer one s ship but it isn t a destination many will ever reach that apology you hoped for may never be coming or may never fill the hole you hoped it would seeing your perpetrator suffer rarely makes your suffering feel any lighter hollywood endings are make believe but grace and forgiveness are real and accessible and their power towards healing often takes people by surprise so i will not answer your question as a diplomat or politician but i am not someone who hasn t sat at a table and helped negotiate functional treaties with trauma before it can be done in this case it would mean israel taking the bold and courageous step of choosing diplomacy and restraint over brute military force not because brute military force could not be justified but because it will ultimately further the cycle of trauma and escalation that is in no one s interest including israel s own israel could have seized the moment of initial international sympathy and shock to draw in closer to its western allies and the strained but with some recent progress towards normalizing relationships with the arab world itself and amplify international condemnation of hamas and unite pressure on and isolation of hamas amongst those who otherwise might have been less willing or engaged israel could have strengthened its relationship with fatah plo in the west bank through restarting meaningful negotiations there in return for real security guarantees and thereby showed the benefits of the alternative to the approach hamas took in gaza and israel could have negotiated prisoner exchanges for the hostages while also giving a clear deadline for further steps including militarily if the negotiations did not progress the negotiations would need time and undoubtedly gruelling patience and involvement from arab partners if they were to be fruitful but there may have been space for them to be successful under the right circumstances particularly if israel was able to use its restraint and its reopening of negotiations with fatah to build on its progress with normalizing its relationships in the arab world is this fair is this justice those are the wrong questions sadly if you are truly committed to healing and breaking free of the cycle of mutual destruction that is driving israelis and palestinians into the blood saturated ground a ground that doesn t care at all about fairness or justice as it swallows up generation and generation of people who were convinced that vengeance and

israel and per arab sources of the arabs exited between december and this means the number ranges between to arabs there are two main phases of the israeli war of independence or as the palestinians refer to it as the nakba phase one november through to mid may of the decision to partition the land to an arab and jewish state is adopted by the un in november of accepted by the jews and rejected by the arabs in this phase the british mandate is still in effect there is no israeli army formally there is the paramilitary organization of hagana which at the time is mostly focused on defending jewish towns and neighborhoods from arab attacks during this time at least to arabs leave and they do so on their own accord the reasons for their leaving range from not wanting to be part of the new jewish state if they stay according the un partition map and some out of fear from the impending full scale war that neighboring arab states were threatening if the jewish state were to be created these people were not expelled by israel in any shape or form the second phase from mid may through to the armistice signed in in this phase some arabs were expelled by israel some escaped because of the fear of war and some were advised to leave by arab countries and return with the victorious arab armies so during this period another to exit it is virtually impossible to tell what percent of these people left solely because they were expelled by the israeli army all evidence is that there was no formal policy of expulsion so even if were expelled by israel that would mean to people the claim one can make is that after the war ended they were not allowed back in but in all fairness their condition to coming back was the dismantling for the jewish state and also the jews that were expelled from arab countries were not let back in either the arab exodus began voluntarily as early as december when established arab families in haifa and jaffa realized that according to the un partition plan the cities they lived in were slated to fall under jewish control similarly wealthy arab residents from the western neighborhoods of jerusalem began to leave in historian benny morris s words the arab flight became a sort of contagious disease spreading from house to house neighbor to neighbor street to street neighborhood to neighborhood and later from village to village the upper and educated classes feared being killed or wounded and feared the anarchy that accompanied the gradual withdrawal of the british civil and military administration most of the high class families who left haifa jerusalem jaffa acre and tiberias believed their exile would be temporary this phenomenon was described in the contemporary palestinian press as follows the first group of the fifth column traitors are those abandoning their homes and businesses and going to live elsewhere many of them lived in great comfort and luxury as soon as the first sign of trouble appeared they took off to avoid bearing the burden of the struggle directly or indirectly the neighboring countries did us a great disservice by accepting these who fled the battlefield they are the worst type of our fifth column traitors and deserve the harshest punishment from the palestinian newspaper al sha ab june according to morris following their departure the peasants and urban poor were also forced to leave having witnessed the mass flight of the wealthy which led to the closure of businesses schools law offices clinics and public services adding to this was the withdrawal of the british the departing people left due to fear of being left to face the zionist enemy alone despite the poverty and difficulty associated with leaving morris describes the first months of for the arabs of palestine as follows feelings of general collapse and disintegration in many places a small spark was enough to make the residents pack up and flee residents of arab cities fled and in doing so dragged along with them the rural population of the surrounding areas the causes for the departure of roughly a quarter million arabs in the first half of were largely internal arab causes lack of leadership economic hardship breakdown of law and order the voluntary departure in the early months of the war due to the absence of leadership and collapse of order can be seen in this report from a palestinian newspaper the residents of the large village of sheikh munis and many other arab villages in the tel aviv area have disgraced us all by abandoning their villages with their belongings and their children one cannot avoid comparing this shameful flight with the steadfast stance of the haganah in settlements located in arab regions but what use are comparisons for we all know that the haganah rushes into battle with courage while we flee from war from the palestinian newspaper al siraj march the voluntary departure in spring due to calls from arab leaders and institutions is reflected in this report from the economist correspondent in palestine in the days that followed the israeli authorities who now had full control of haifa called upon all arabs to remain and assured them that no harm would come to them to the best of my knowledge all british residents who were asked by their arab friends advised them to stay various factors influenced their decision to flee there is little doubt that the strongest factor was the broadcasts from the arab higher committee which called on all arabs to leave haifa it was made clear to them that once british forces completed their evacuation the armies of all the arab states would invade palestine and drive the jews into the sea it was also implied that any arabs who remained in haifa and accepted jewish protection would be considered traitors at that time the arabs of palestine still had some trust in the arab league s ability to deliver on its promises from the economist london october about two years later the editor of the lebanese newspaper al huda habib issa summarized the matter in hindsight in an editorial immediately after the british publicly announced their departure from the mandate in palestine the arab league began convening meetings and conferences its secretary general abdul rahman azzam pasha issued many declarations promising the arab nations that conquering palestine and tel aviv effectively the jewish capital would be as simple as a military parade azzam s statements noted that the armies were already at the borders and that the millions of pounds spent by the jews on land acquisition and economic development would surely fall into arab hands since it would be a simple matter to throw the jews into the mediterranean the arabs of palestine had no choice but to listen to the advice of the league and believe what azzam pasha and others told them that leaving their lands was only temporary and would end within days with the successful completion of the arab campaign of punishment against israel from the daily lebanese newspaper al huda june expulsion orders formal organized expulsion orders were issued to palestinian arabs during the war on two main occasions during the implementation of plan dalet when the haganah shifted from defense to offense and expelled arabs from key transport routes and border areas after the conquest of ramla and lydda there is no dispute that some of the refugees were expelled but the actual number is likely less than of those who actually left the new historians with the opening of israeli and british archives years after the war a new wave of research emerged led by the so called new historians these scholars argued that everything previously published about the war was largely zionist propaganda by official historians however even they had to acknowledge many arabs left without being expelled their criticism of israel was that israeli policy was to prevent their return even when they wanted to return their return was banned villages destroyed fields ruined

and then pointed at you as the person who didn t want to make peace while you were refusing to let him have his bedroom back maybe you did concede under great pressure okay i won t take any more of your house or i ll try to take over your house at a slower rate than i was doing before but that doesn t obligate your neighbor to accept this term while he is living from the linens closet it especially doesn t because should he agree to that he has just legitimized the fact that you took over so much of his house he still wants to sleep in his own bedroom that s not wrong any way you look at it the person who kicked the homeowner out is wrong for not giving him back his bedroom maybe conditions since then have led to a situation of injustice should the person give the homeowner back his bedroom children have been born refugees have emigrated there is a whole new populace that would be displaced but the answer is not pretend this guy is wrong for wanting his bedroom back if it was neighbors in a house i m sure we could figure out a solution the truth is that jews and arabs were coexisting in the area under ottoman rule for a long time before the balfour declaration and they could again however zionists want their democratic country to have a specific demographic otherwise it is not a jewish democracy it is anyone s democracy so they cannot put up with too many of any other race existing there this is the crux of the issue this is why they try to say that arabs will not tolerate our existence at all they want us all to die when it is really not true except for possibly a few extremists who have been radicalized by you guessed it israeli oppression i don t think it s as much an opinion about the rightness or wrongness of these actions as it is how you try to color them and the fact is that there is no other way to color it s wrong to steal than this this supposed conflict is a coloring page with a black and white center and layers of pictures around it people who are very pro palestine might color outside the lines or color things in the pictures colors that they aren t sometimes and people who are pro israeli do the same but that doesn t change the black and white core of this issue you can t take homes that weren t yours and expect the homeowners to just chill out and relax about it what you can do is color the periphery of the page in as vibrant and distracting colors as you can so that anyone looking at it will be confused so you re right i was incorrect about israel never put settlement slowdowns on the negotiation table but in the end this is sort of inconsequential the settlements are illegal that s not my opinion it is a fact', 'another dishonest half truth many arab residents fled because arab leaders told them to leave temporarily while they drove the jews into the sea others left to avoid living under jewish rule yes in a few places there were expulsions but that s what happens in wars especially wars started by your side you don t get to start a war gamble everything and then act shocked that it didn t go your way again with deflection and moving goalposts again distorted timeline k palestinians didn t leave before israel independence due to arab israel war that was after israel independence also before and after the war arabs didn t call palestinians to leave although it s common sense to leave battlefield there was no arab palestinian state in none the land was under ottoman rule then british rule arab palestinian national identity only started forming in opposition to jewish self determination not independently and while you re crying about sovereignty jewish communities were building towns farming land they legally purchased and creating democratic institutions they didn t inhibit arab sovereignty they were trying to survive awni abd al hadi rafiq tamimi and izzat darwaza were palestinians responsible for establishing first arab independent movement fatat since which constructed the first arab congress in to call for independence for levant and arab countries and paved the way for the arab revolution against ottman followed by opposing the british mandate palestine as well as colonies of britian were countries that didn t exist yet guess that s point of self independence maybe all of these countries still had the legitimate right of self sovereignty of its people over their majority land all of these countries had the same struggle during the relatively the same time and nobody questioned it again with most absurd self oriented narrative palestinian didn t want their rights they wanted to oppose jews it amazes me how this mindset is common as much as its ridiculous literally the whole of the me where fighting any european foreign entity french and english had their fair share of fights across the me zionists didn t inhibit palestenain sovereignty they survived on the same way a thieve don t rob a bank but survives nice try but the arab side rejected exactly that in the s israel offered to take back refugees as a humanitarian gesture arab leaders said no in at camp david israel offered a full state with land swaps and even partial return arafat walked out and launched a terror war you can t pretend the offer never existed just because your side rejected it returning less than a quarter of expelled people isn t a full right of return but falsely compromise it s simply right not a favour and all expelled people must have it mentioning more deals that insisted on neglecting your ethnic cleansing helps no better done but how about this put yourself in the shoes of jews who had no state who faced pogroms in europe and the arab world and who saw the world do nothing during the holocaust then they finally reestablish their homeland get attacked on day one and still get blamed for trying to survive if you re asking me to sympathize with one side while erasing the history of the other that s not justice that s propaganda i have a minor issue with your narrative the jewish struggle is mainly caused in europe i wouldn t blame palestinians who have done nothing to jews before zionism for european persecution there is nowadays more jews in america than in israel jews succeed in criminalising antisemitism and allied with europeans what is left is not making other people from different contient who done nothing pay for past persecution of jews another slight issue zionsts didn t get attacked out of nowhere since the very beginning they had to demolish palestenain self determination over their entitled land to create theirs', 'point of clarification at the time of this immigration which at some point was halted by the british at the request of arab leaders palestinians were considered the jews in the region arabs just considered themselves arab though some called themselves palestinian arab references in news regarding palestine related to jews these kind of facts often get lost in the discussion about israel s founding because palestinian is a political label they took up on the s at the behest of arafat to consolidate their movement because that s what it was a political movement similar to how some now perceive zionism as only a political philosophy when the original post here correctly relates it directly to judaism i think the fervor was in the air in the s and onward and it was pretty well known the jews were moving toward statehood as more continue to move to the region that was one reason arab leaders asked the british to stem the flow of jewish immigration the arabs never had any intent of living peaceably side by side jews if jews had sovereignty over themselves with that said i m a very liberal atheist zionist jew and so i ve always supported ss but i think it s safe to say at this point that the arabs never wanted that and i don t see it happening in my lifetime i m late s what s wild is that even after they still don t they still persist in a right of return and a ss both of which will never happen and which i think they re well aware of but have never stopped demanding as a people they ve never been further from freedom than they are now the war is awful and it s very sad to see the photos from it but the palestinians have no real leaders to negotiate meaningfully for them which is sad in and of itself they ve been used as bomb fodder by their corrupt leaders for decades for unattainable goals as israel is not going to be dismantled if so all the hostages would ve been released long ago to end the suffering of their people the path forward for palestinians after all this time will be a difficult one they lost a war in the s and never stopped their violence when diplomacy has always been an option for a lot of jews around the world it s hard to understand how people can support that position when that ship sailed when they lost the first war and didn t take advantage of that to form their own nation or come to the table with reasonable negotiations they just doubled down on religious terrorism as their guiding light this position is so illogical and does nothing to advance their cause so it boggles the mind that the west has subscribed to this narrative also all that settler colonial nonsense etc has been depressing for me to see as i majored in sociology lol according to that theory israel was technically decolonized when israel was founded anyway try not to listen to pro pal folks too much their movement is steeped in jew hatred and is pretty much all islamist propaganda driven by religious ideology and feeling not by historical facts and logic']"

nobody legitimate is claiming that what israel is doing is a genocide purely because of the death toll maybe some random redditor said that to you in the comments but your post makes it seem like that s a widely held belief listen buddy your experiences are not my experiences you re partially right informed people cite a broader range of reasons but even on reddit and other social media platforms the death toll is constantly used as the centerpiece of moral arguments and the simpletons in question here often blackmail you emotionally because of it stating something along the lines of k dead genocide and they shout this out far more often than references to international law legal thresholds of intent or definitions under the genocide convention that s the bs i was pointing out if sheer body count is your criteria then yes october th would also qualify under that logic even if the execution scale was smaller you can t claim the moral high ground by focusing on outcomes while ignoring intent in actuality the allegations of genocide are usually centered around israel s decision to agreed and i ll even acknowledge that those allegations deserve investigation and scrutiny but israel has stated its intent is to dismantle hamas which is a group that carried out a massacre and openly calls for israel s destruction now can a counterterror campaign go too far and violate humanitarian law of course can a disproportionate response lead to war crimes yes that s why those charges exist separately from genocide but to cross into genocide you must prove intent to destroy a population as such and intent is incredibly hard to prove which is why the bar is so high in international law israeli ministers have made appalling comments but they also exist in a country with a history of internal accountability even if imperfect for hamas that action was confined to a single day years ago so the timeline is your issue and you call my post awful tsk tsk yes it was one day in which over civilians were intentionally murdered women raped families burned alive and children kidnapped that s ideological extermination which also serves as grounds for genocide in intent even if not in scale you don t need to perform mental gymnastics to prove that because hamas s charter calls for the destruction of the jewish state and people they ve said it plainly and repeatedly the only reason october th didn t reach rwanda like numbers is because they were physically stopped the fact that they wanted to go further but couldn t is key you don t get to say well it was just one day when that day s goal was the obliteration of a population genocide has never been about killing as many people as possible in as fast a time as possible it s about destroying a population systematically in whole or in part through a variety of means particularly when trying to do it under international scrutiny yes and israel clearly has the capacity to do more harm than it has it s not something i m suggesting israel should boast about but it s something to note when intent is being questioned if israel truly intended to wipe out palestinians they have the means they haven t that fact alone isn t exoneration but it s relevant to the question of whether genocide is truly underway or whether we re witnessing a brutal counterterror operation against a terror group that embeds itself among civilians by your own example the germans in namibia created death camps however they didn t allow humanitarian corridors they didn t drop leaflets urging evacuation they didn t provide water power or aid after the fighting began israel has done all those things even if insufficiently again i m trying to get it through thick skulls it s not proof of moral purity but it questions intent this post was horrible i would recommend you delete it and try again if you didn t like it that s your opinion but just because you disagree doesn t mean it lacks value the post was simply meant to challenge oversimplified questions like if israel were really trying to defend itself why are so many palestinians dead that question gets asked daily and it deserves a hard uncomfortable answer i tried to provide one', 'the aspect that i take issue with is that the icj has specifically said that s not the case if you re inferring genocidal intent from a pattern of conduct which amnesty international is doing in their report ai cites icj s croatia v serbia judgment they even cite paragraph of it on page of their report paragraph of the icj s judgment states the court recalls that in the passage in question in its judgment it accepted the possibility of genocidal intent being established indirectly by inference the notion of reasonableness must necessarily be regarded as implicit in the reasoning of the court thus to state that for a pattern of conduct to be accepted as evidence of existence of genocidal intent it must be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent amounts to saying that in order to infer the existence of dolus specialis from a pattern of conduct it is necessary and sufficient that this is the only inference that could reasonably be drawn from the acts in question to interpret paragraph of the judgment in any other way would make it impossible to reach conclusions by way of inference if amnesty international is going to infer genocidal intent from the acts israel has done then it is necessary that genocide is the only inference that can be drawn from the acts if any other reasonable inference can be drawn from the acts then it s impossible to conclude genocidal intent from the actions for example a reasonable inference from the acts israel has done is that they re fighting a war and just don t care about palestinian lives and are committing other not genocide war crimes by targeting civilians if that s the case then genocidal intent cannot be established through inference and since genocidal intent is necessary to commit genocide you can not conclude israel is doing genocide amnesty international changes that to only reasonable inference that the state also has the intent to destroy the group in whole or in part if genocidal intent is to be inferred from a pattern of conduct then there is no also amnesty international doesn t care and infers genocidal intent even though genocide is not the only reasonable inference from israel s pattern of conduct essentially amnesty international thinks the icj s way of inferring genocidal intent is too narrow so they change it so they can say israel is committing genocide it s gross and wrong and is easy to see', 'does israel have a plan of complete extermination like the nazis did i don t think so you seem to believe that a genocide can only fit this description but in fact the legal definition is far broader than that no it s not far broader than that the legal definition requires a specific intent to biologically destroy a protected group in whole or in part so yes they do need to have a specific intent for complete extermination of the palestinians in gaza or a part that is substantial to their biological survival e g the entire male population if there s no intent to physically destroy a protected group there s simply no genocide beyond the legal considerations i used this term to qualify the very real destructive intent toward pakestinian identity and society the gov seeks to destroy all possibility of life in gaza to destroy institutions and the entire social fabric of course it wants to destroy institutions of an enemy that has a singular desire to eliminate them and a social fabric that s deeply embedded with said enemy the allies in ww destroyed german and japanese institutions entire social fabric in wars against their entire societies while killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and burning multiple cities to the ground they did not commit a genocide even the most gentle kinds of serious wars like the iraq war where the goal was not merely to not target the civilian population according to ihl rules but to make friends with them and be greeted as liberators by no means the default obvious or legally required case was still about destroying institutions and to some extent social fabric which was deeply embedded with baath arguing that destroying institutions makes a genocide doesn t just go beyond legal considerations it goes beyond any reasonable definition of genocide full stop as for destroying all possibility of life in gaza as i said the very existence of the ghf undermines this thesis not supports it but even if we just conclude that the goal here is to make gaza unlivable in order to expel the palestinians to somewhere else it means it s not genocidal intent the law is very clear on this the icty and icj ruled that actual close range massacres not merely bulldozing buildings are not genocide because they were aimed to expel rather than destroy to this day most israelis do not recognize the palestinian plight as a legitimate aspiration that s a pretty wild argument do you think any of israel s enemies throughout its entire history recognized the plight of the jewish people and their legitimate aspirations to a state or for that matter their even more legitimate aspiration to not have their existing state eliminated and its jewish population subjugated expelled or exterminated the actual palestinian aspiration and the root cause of the palestinian plight does that mean that every war israel has fought not just oct th and not just against the palestinians was actually a genocide against the israeli jews when snipers systematically shoot children in the head this goes beyond simple war crimes it s not clear it s even war crimes at all let alone it being systematic a word that doesn t just mean happened multiple times or even committed by idf soldiers to begin with but let s assume for a moment that the idf high command ordered snipers to shoot dozens of innocent palestinian children in the head that would be a war crime and a crime against humanity of murder it would not even be the crime of extermination let alone genocide genocide doesn t mean war crimes that are exceptionally cruel anymore than it means wars that disrupt institutions and social structures again if israel actually had genocidal intent it would not be risking its soldiers lives to snipe at a few dozen random palestinian children or to use live fire for crowd control it would be carrying out the kinds of mass close range executions we ve seen in all the actual genocides including oct th we would at least see the israelis actually doing what they were accused for months of doing and firebombing the mawasi refugee area or simply starving all the gazans to death israel had the means and the opportunity to destroy the gazans for over a year and a half the fact it didn t do it shows it simply doesn t have the intent']"

believe it is possible for many people to get lost in the weeds and not take in a text as a whole you re welcome i agree that it s easy to miss the context with these verses and i can t blame the people who do if i were them reading the violent verses without knowing the first thing that i d think probably wouldn t be if i had all the historical context i m wondering if you could elaborate upon something that i ve heard about as it seems that your image quotes one is al tabari a hadith from what i understand the qur an is law and the hadith s are kind of up to each believer as in people who are muslim must agree with the qur an but don t necessarily have to believe the hadith s i do plan on visiting a mosque locally in my city and this is one of the questions i would plan to ask i do need to first google what practices to observe when visiting al tabari is a tafsir tafsirs are basically stuff that is written to explain verses in the qur an from what i understand the qur an is law and the hadith s are kind of up to each believer as in people who are muslim must agree with the qur an but don t necessarily have to believe the hadith s well we believe that the qur an is the holy book of guidance sent by god whereas the hadiths are man made recordings of the life of prophet muhammed pbuh both are necessary of course for example muslims pray to god five times a day the thing is the qu ran doesn t say that it s only the hadiths that say we have to pray five times a day so they are both very necessary for muslims for the second part where muslims don t necessarily have to believe in the hadiths well that depends the thing with the qur an is that it is one book that we believe has never changed since it was first made so we know to follow that but with hadiths there are thousands of hadiths and not all of them are credible some are weak some are inauthentic etc so with hadiths we need to make sure its the correct one whereas with the qur an we don t need to worry about that also the hadiths mostly tell what is sunnah things that the prophet did that we can also do but that s optional etc anyway yeah to us the qur an is pretty much superior than the hadith the only ones who don t follow the hadith whatsoever are qur anists but the qur anists belief that only the qur an should be followed and not the hadith is an incorrect belief and there is a lot of evidence supporting this i do plan on visiting a mosque locally in my city and this is one of the questions i would plan to ask i do need to first google what practices to observe when visiting i can refute criticisms of islam well but yeah a mosque would be the better place to ask for questions like this about the hadith the practices to observe when visiting well i probably don t know everything that i would recommend you to do but here s some instead of saying hi or hello say assalaam allaykum it s arabic for peace be upon you and it s how we greet people call men brother and women sister it s more respectful in islam and maybe more that i can t think of yeah probably better to just google it for context i believe i originally came across this when listening to a muslim speak on the age of consent and that apparently depending on which texts followers choose to believe the number can be different i don t think there is an age of consent in islam but i m not sure you could probably ask on it though', 'the west doesn t think it s core values are in line with radical islam as much as they don t think it s in line with radical christianity and certainly not radical extremist judaism as a muslim living in the west i believe that western nations have every right to take a stance against any and every extremist idea intolerance can t be tolerated especially in a society with a great variety of different people living next to each other which is the case in many western countries speaking about islam one has to ask itself what islam and radical islam and mild islam are about the reason for most of the reactionist attitudes among the people in the middle east towards the west is not religiously motivated it s because the west implemented foreign policies for the sake of their economic oil gas etc and trade interests which wrecked havoc on middle eastern soil no one can deny this by know moving on to your question how should islam as a religion be seen in the west now and in the future i think that my religion islam is perfectly in line with western core values here is why i grew up in the netherlands and have as a muslim every right as every other citizen in the nl most importantly the freedom of religion in islam there is no compulsion in religion you can t force anyone to become muslim because the hearts of people are in the hands of allah muslims believe see holy quran and so these two principles freedom of religion and no compulsion in islam are in the basis the ingredients for a tolerant relation between western nations and muslims however and this is the most important point there are people who totally don t like the idea of islam becoming a part of western nations trying to take advantage of every opportunity and doing their best to create and mobilize negative vibes towards muslims people who feel pressured and threatened by muslims who follow the rules of their religion pray and basically just live their belief are either very ignorant of islam and the prophet muhammed pbuh or they are uncertain and unsure about their own way of living beliefs and values furthermore if i believe my religion has a lot to add to other people s lives and i want to share information with others because of this reason and i m not forcing anyone to do anything everyone has the right to choose the way they believe without other people being disturbed there is a lot more to this but summing up for know islam is perfectly in line with western values and muslims have every ingredient in their religion to peacefully live in a western society among western people together with western people', 'no islam is uniquely bad islam is unique in that the violence towards nonbelievers is prescriptive not descriptive the command from god is open and still running with regard to islam as opposed to christianity judaism and that means something the old testament has descriptive and prescriptive parts as an example their is a story where god kills every egyptian first born this is presented as historical narrative but is most likely a fairytail it is in no way a divine commandment for jews to kill egyptian first borns in perpetuity in fact jews didn t kill them according to the bible an angel of the lord did the conquest of canaan is also like a fairytale history textbook it is descriptive god told moses but of the cities of these peoples which the lord your god gives you as an inheritance you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive but you shall utterly destroy them the hittite amorite canaanite perizzite hivite and jebusite just as the lord your god has commanded you lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods and you sin against the lord your god so joshua moses successor conquered all the land the mountain country and the south and the lowland and the wilderness slopes and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of israel had commanded god clearly ordered the hebrews to annihilate the canaanites and surrounding peoples such violence is therefore an expression of god s will for good or ill regardless all the historic violence committed by the hebrews and recorded in the old testament is just that history it happened god commanded it but it revolved around a specific time bc and place canaan and was directed against a specific people canaanites at no time did such violence go on to become standardized or codified into jewish law in short biblical accounts of violence are descriptive not prescriptive the prescriptive part of the old testament is the laws of moses these are the laws telling jews how to live their life while some of these are gross like stoning an adulter to death none provide an open ended invitation to wage war in perpetuity against non jews feel free to look at all the laws of moses if you need to likewise violence in the new testament isn t prescriptive it s prophetic descriptiveof future events jesus will return in revelations and they will wage war against the lamb but the lamb will triumph over them because he is lord of lords and king of kings and with him will be his called chosen and faithful followers the bible is telling you how things will play out in the future not commanding you to go to war with unbelievers it is descriptive of future events this is where islamic violence is unique though similar to the violence of the old testament commanded by god and manifested in history certain aspects of islamic violence and intolerance have become standardized in islamic law and apply at all times thus while the violence found in the qur an has a historical context its ultimate significance is theological consider the following qur anic verses then when the sacred months are drawn away slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them and confine them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way fight those who believe not in god and the last day and do not forbid what god and his messenger have forbidden such men as practise not the religion of truth being of those who have been given the book until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled as with old testament verses where god commanded the hebrews to attack and slay their neighbors these verses also have a historical context god first issued these commandments after the muslims under muhammad s leadership had grown sufficiently strong to invade their christian and pagan neighbors but unlike the bellicose verses and anecdotes of the old testament the sword verses became fundamental to islam s subsequent relationship to both the people of the book i e jews and christians and the idolaters i e hindus buddhists animists etc and in fact set off the islamic conquests which changed the face of the world forever based on qur an for instance islamic law mandates that idolaters and polytheists must either convert to islam or be killed simultaneously qur an is the primary source of islam s well known discriminatory practices against conquered christians and jews living under islamic suzerainty in other words these aren t descriptive verses but rather open ended prescriptive verses in fact based on the sword verses as well as countless other qur anic verses and oral traditions attributed to muhammad islam s learned officials sheikhs muftis and imams throughout the ages have all reached consensus binding on the entire muslim community that islam is to be at perpetual war with the non muslim world until the former subsumes the latter indeed it is widely held by muslim scholars that since the sword verses are among the final revelations on the topic of islam s relationship to non muslims that they alone have abrogated some of the qur an s earlier and more tolerant verses such as no compulsion is there in religion again the sword verses are prescriptive and open ended verses not descriptive and closed verses like in the new and old testament islam is still running its bad code']"

shifted in the middle east living there and visiting a lot i remember iranian women telling me i missed the good old days to palestinan women remembering walking around the middle east as a whole more freely to wanting to be good neighbors with israel i m a woman so not alone with men in the middle east much etc but everytime i missed a bomb or everytime i hear something like ms iraq was nice to ms israel at a beauty contest thar caused her to be kicked out of her country to whatever i knew something is shifting and it is bad but back to i thought more good than evil and i still believe that but i don t think all the good people have the power anymore i don t think israelis defense makes sense to the point of hamas ideology won t die off this way i recall hamas and hezbollah people don t get along maybe for now they will due to the world s reactions after oct th i am in awe to find out how much time and money hamas spent on destroying israel that i do wonder if that time and money went to bomb shelters and citizens maybe palestine would have formed i mean jordan and iran are young countries too i don t know what i don t know but i know when the victim said she wants nobody to feel what she felt that day and described knowing every town that she missed a terrorist attack by minutes she meant every word she knows she is traumatized and knows she needs help but i feel she hasn t lost her humanity she believes there are more good people than bad and bad people tried to rape and kill her that day but someone saved her']"

start off by agreeing that any person who is pro one side is less educated if you are pro one side you definitely didnt take the time to internalize how complex the situation is now saying that nelson mandela said israel is an apartheid state is an appeal to authority which is no offence a tool utilized more by the uneducated who practice critical thinking less the claim that mandela said it doesn t make it true even the claim itself is disputed can you provide a source that mandela believed israel is an apartheid state first we must accept that apartheid is a spectrum not a binary every society has a certain degree is apartheid characteristics in it second we need to define what apartheid is and whether israel practices it your definition alludes to racism but racism is inarguably prevalent in every society apartheid is not the same for one apartheid by the very definition means separation or as it is understood today segregation does israel practice segregation absolutely not all israeli citizens regardless of racism ethnicity religion etc are equal and can generally go wherever they want there are laws against segregation does israel put the west bank under military control in order to protect settlers who are illegally there absolutely there are a few exceptions which are highly controversial which is why i said apartheid is a spectrum one is the city of hebron in the west bank where jews and palestinians are separated by force this has been put due to numerous clashes between the populations imo the jews there should just leave another issue is that jews are not allowed into the temple mount and al aqsa mosque inside again the reason is security just to quickly address the other claims the claim about ethiopian jews is blatantly false the majority stand with israel they complain about racism not segregation there are way fewer issues with the west bank even though the settlers there keep abusing them i m not suggesting an explanation just saying what you said is not true i would argue that most israelis so want a two state solution that was the goal for the oslo accords although it failed i think that the sentiment among the majority still prefers a two state solution over occupation the only fear is that the palestinian state will not stop pursuing the ambition to remove all jews from the territory and to finish i am personally pro forgetting the past and finding a solution for the future both sides will have to make compromises', 'reply to a challenge to those who claim israel is an apartheid state failing to answer so posting a new thread here are reasons why israel cannot even resemble an apartheid state i challenge you to give even only breasons why you think it is so let s go over you claims i do suspect however that you are looking for equivalence i e you want south african apartheid and israeli apartheid to be exactly the same they are not israel to its credit is smarter than rsa and does many of the egregious things nicely under the table see below all people living in israel have equal rights there are no inferior or second class citizens unlike non whites in south africa or minorities in islamic or arab countries this claim is false one very simple example some israeli citizens do not have the right or ability to be married in the state of israel simply due to their ethno religious status indeed if you wish to explore this particular region of israeli inequality in depth there are actually five classes of citizens dm me for a more in depth answer another example an additional and completely different set of some people who reside in an area israel has annexed legally or illegally is irrelevant for this portion of the discussion were not granted citizenship at the time of annexation or since i speak of course of the residents of jerusalem the east portion of which was annexed by israel disenfranchising its population and we should also mention some people in the west bank who while residing in an area occupied by israel for some years are subject to military law and lack franchise these people despite being in israel s loving iron grip lack the most basic rights of any kind this very basic and first instance is in itself sufficient to label israel as apartheid you know just slightly pregnant is fully pregnant an arab judge george karra sentenced an ex israeli president moshe kansas to prison for years what has this to do with israel being or not being an apartheid state a judge who happened to be an arab sentenced a rapist who happened to be an ex president to prison again you seem to be looking for equivalence with rsa israel and rsa are not the same in the bantu education act was passed in south africa setting up a different educational system for blacks to focus on manual labor jobs in israel everyone is given equal opportunity in the workplace and educational department as evidenced by the fact there are palestinians and arabs in israeli universities who both study and teach as professors your comments on the israeli educational system is misleading first arab and moslem teachers are not found in the jewish educational systems there are three or four separate of the latter the orthodox religious educational systems do not accept anyone but their own specific ilk of people the national religious accept only national religious and orthodox religious and the national system accepts anyone who happens to be jewish without formally saying no arabs unless an arab actually is considered for a position at which point parents outcries are usually enough to make an arab teacher not the right fit at this point in time so sad so sad additionally up until all arab teachers has to be vetted by the general security service gss and would you believe it at this time i e in this vetting is in the process of being reinstated by the current government incitement to racism is a criminal offense in israel you are absolutely right and yes i can give many more examples just tell me where you want them from arabs and israelis receive the same care and treatment in the same hospitals that is for now correct of course the current minister of finance non whites in south africa had separate amenities hospitals beaches bathrooms even park benches they were allowed to sit on that is correct israel has no bits like this but see you point above and my answer to it no it has not yet happened israeli arabs have their own political parties in the knesset some of whom are israel s harshest critics but in rsa blacks had their own autonomies countries almost they were better off just kidding yes arabs have their own parties arab citizens are allowed to seek redress through the courts and government if they feel they have been wronged true arabs in israel have more fundamental rights than other islamic and arab countries in the middle east ironically they have more rights than they do in the gaza strip or the west bank irrelevant we are discussing israel s apartheid not the failures and these are numerous of arab states incitement israel there are million arab citizens integrated within israeli society they make up percent of israel s population according to a poll done by harvard university percent of arabs citizens living in israel would rather live there than any other country in the world if these citizens were experiencing apartheid why are so many supportive of israel there is no equivalence first million arabs are not the entirety of israeli arab population you must need include the residents of jerusalem and the million residents of the occupied west bank even without including the two latter groups israel has multiple citizen classes regimentalizing their access to citizens rights access to work this is a separate issue that should be discussed and other sundry matters no israel s apartheid is not south african apartheid but it is an apartheid separate and different ethnical groups having separate and unequal rights and treatment', 'israel is an apartheid state']"

come from donations gathered by the un and international humanitarian groups who usually buy the food in the west bank jordan or abroad and transport it through israel to gaza according to humanitarian sources the idf does not allow the supplies to be properly secured before trucks leave kerem shalom to enter the areas where starving gazans live sources in gaza report that idf soldiers rush aid workers to load cargo quickly then trucks are often delayed for hours and forced to take dangerous routes because the food isn t securely tied down it s easy to steal and most of the aid entering gaza is looted on the way some food also spills due to severe road damage for months the un and humanitarian aid groups have pleaded with the idf to allow food to enter through other crossings to give them time to secure and protect shipments and to use safer routes to ensure aid reaches those in need their requests have been repeatedly denied this is just one of many obstacles that israel places in the way of feeding gaza s residents and stopping the hunger crisis on the surface there is a puzzling gap between israel s repeated claims of increasing food supplies to gaza and the ongoing daily reports of deaths from starvation and severe malnutrition especially among children obstacles imposed by israel diaspora affairs minister amichai chikli has blocked dozens of organizations attempting to deliver aid police have failed to provide the necessary escort for trucks crossing from the jordanian border the idf delays trucks at the kerem shalom crossing and limits loading times which impacts drivers ability to secure the cargo the kerem shalom crossing is closed on fridays and saturdays aid workers and international volunteers are not permitted to enter gaza through kerem shalom at the same time as the trucks the idf has established checkpoints within gaza that impede the movement of trucks gaza s social order is rapidly deteriorating because many police officers have been targeted by the idf unrwa s activities are being disrupted restrictions persist on the entry of certain medical supplies and foods the reason is that humanitarian organizations and un agencies including the world food program unicef the world health organization and dozens more have been unable to rebuild the food distribution network that operated in gaza before the current crisis began on march at that time israel closed the border crossings for days entirely causing the network to collapse', 'your post is dripping with sarcasm and outrage at this moment there are current global conflicts with more casualties and more displaced than the israel gaza war but fine you ve chosen this one as your hill to die on so the problem is that hamas has stolen the food and aid that has gone in to gaza previously stolen from the civilian population stolen food and medicine from starving children that need it this has made it challenging to get food to the people that need it you may or may not know that the palestinian peace advocate ahmed fouad alkhatib recommended parachuting aid in because it was harder to intercept which israel and other countries were doing i don t blame you for being concerned when i googled whether people were starving here were the headlines nbc starvation looms as israel s total blockade on gaza enters its third month starvation is not happening but it looms al jaz updates israel kills world complicit in starvation of gaza children note no mention if the were all hamas part hamas and the implicit call for nations to do something and of course the mention of children again current conflicts in the world in similar or worse situation un news gaza worst case scenario unfolds as brutal aid blockade threatens mass starvation note it is not here yet but threatening un news gazans face hunger crisis as aid blockade nears two months bbc news gaza mass starvation warning the strangest thing is that israel is expected to deliver food to its enemy as if england delivered food to the germans in ww in any event there is a story days ago about idf planning major shift in gaza aid delivery in bid to thwart hamas diversion the plan is that international organizations and private security contractors will hand out boxes of food to individual gazan families the whole sale distribution of food wasn t working because it was all being stolen by the criminally unethical hamas and its palestinian supporters in the new plan each family will have a designated representative tasked with reaching a security zone in southern gaza where aid will be distributed each box will have enough food to last several days then the family representatives return to the security zone to receive the next parcel israel believes this method will make it harder for hamas to divert aid to its fighters interestingly now qatar and egypt are supporting an initiative calling for days of calm that would see the release of the remaining israeli captives in exchange for allowing food and shelter i m hopeful and i hope you are as well that hamas will accept this qatar egypt plan they have been prolonging a lot of suffering so people like you can blame israel for all of it according to the deal they would have to release the hostages which would mark a turning point and probably the beginning of the end of the war', 'on the common argument that israel is using starvation as a means of committing genocide while there have been periods where israel has restricted the amount of aid entering gaza they have still facilitated over million tons of aid since the start of the war the reason aid flows have varied significantly is due to israel being influenced by ceasefire negotiations various military operations shifting border policies and logistical constraints currently the only part of gaza where famine has been declared is in gaza city a km stretch of land note that the gaza strip is km in its entirety in northern gaza that is outside of the designated humanitarian zones where it remains a major combat zone due to hamas still retaining control over significant areas especially civilian populated neighborhoods israel has just launched operation gideon s chariots ii four days ago to advance into this area a famine is classified using the integrated food security phase classification ipc when at least of households face extreme food insecurity acute malnutrition in children exceeds and the death rate surpasses two people per per day due to starvation or related causes with gaza s population of over million this would mean at least dead each day for it to be classed as a famine in the whole strip in almost years of fighting the estimated number of dead due to starvation is currently just over half the number required per day to declare a famine for a famine to be declared by the ipc in gaza city independent media investigations show that the ipc lowered the malnutrition threshold from to and shifted its measurement method from the standard weight and height indicators to the less precise mid upper arm circumference muac metric as mentioned in the footnotes of the report they also withdrew the death toll requirement mentioned above the reason this was done was due to an assumption that the number of those dead from starvation is vastly higher than reported however recent scientific studies done on this that take into account non violent deaths alongside the gaza ministry of health s reliability while using the same capture recapture method used by others such as in the often quoted lancet study do not reflect this as the vast majority of estimated deaths as of june according to the publication referenced prior are from violence as opposed to starvation dehydration or disease so just to summarise israel has in fact facilitated large amounts of aid into gaza where israel retains some level of control famine has not been declared famine has only been declared in a localised area where israel lacks control and where hamas still retains de facto governance and control the ipc changed the metrics in order to declare famine in this localised area this declaration is now being used to claim that there is famine in gaza to apply political pressure on israel while playing into the narrative that all of gaza is starving by means of misleading language therefore the presence of famine can be explained as a distribution problem due to hamas s continued actions and refusal to surrender whereby they are intentionally misappropriating humanitarian aid while allowing the people who they still hold control over to starve in order to apply political pressure aka lawfare on israel meanwhile international organisations such as the ipc have been influenced by politicisation through which they have applied an eased methodology with little transparency of doing so edit comments and days later yet not a single person has challenged anything i wrote just insults being thrown with practically every rule broken multiple times let me make some things clear to those who think i am justifying or denying that there is starvation nothing in my post suggests this to those who think i am in approval of israel s conduct nothing in my post suggests this to those who think that i am saying that the amount of aid entering gaza is sufficient nothing in my post suggests this my post is about the declaration of famine and genocide nothing else never believe that anti semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies they know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge but they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words the anti semites have the right to play they even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors they delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert if you press them too closely they will abruptly fall silent loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past jean paul sartre if anyone would like to

against israel claims or maybe international news outlet can t obtain verify and publish the information as quickly as local news it is now occupying a large estate of the front page in cnn and bbc

you default to blaming everything under the sun to be against israel prepare to be called out i ve always said that my sympathies lies with the innocents on both side of the conflict my thoughts go to their family and i condemn their execution i do however think that this was avoidable i won t go as far as say that netanyahu don t care at all about the hostages although sometime i wonder giving him the benefit of doubt i think he just doesn t care enough about them to negotiate with the hamas that is to say if the idf is successful at rescuing the hostages then great but he d rather pursue his goal of total victory over the hamas whatever that means than to have a ceasefire now and get the hostages back via non military means now i get that such decisions can be justified don t negotiate with terrorists or you ll encourage them if hamas is left alive more israeli will die in the future but the reality is that hostage rescue is difficult and failure would very likely lead to the loss of the hostage s life i support an immediate ceasefire ideally permanent but even the hamas dropped that requirement at least until haniyeh got killed with a return of the hostages frankly speaking i don t see the hamas being able to pull off anything that the idf couldn t stop as long as they keep their eyes on the ball so there is no need to waste time which the hostages don t have on a total victory i don t know what the average israeli want i know there are people protesting against the government but i do not know if they represent a majority but i am pretty sure netanyahu has decided that worst come to worst he is willing to lose any hostages that can t be militarily rescued', 'no one says israel netanyahu funded hamas directly but rather that they allowed qatari money to flow into gaza to the hands of hamas since hamas has been the governing force in gaza it runs social programs and police and the government structure schools and hospitals are funded largely by the un and donors thus the money that hamas received can be thought of as money that is meant for welfare development governance etc in gaza israel and specifically netanyahu would say something like we want them to be able to have some basic living standards and we want it to go through us so that they have some incentive to play ball and keep quiet it was known that a lot of this money goes to building tunnels and buying weapons but not letting the money through without any substitute funding for the civil governance would be very problematic too i think the thing we can blame netanyahu for in this context is that he was comfortable with this ugly status quo which would somewhat predictably lead to a major attack instead of being serious about a peace process with the palestinians hamas is evil but in a diplomatic sense what it did was saying we re not willing to live like this for so long the occupation is bad and we need to end it of course the stated ideology of hamas is that there should be no israel but that doesn t mean that every ounce of support given to hamas would back this hawkish stance in isolation if the gazans were under the impression that a deal that gives them a state is imminent they would not support hamas so much or perhaps the hamas apparatus would become more dovish as for what bibi knew or didn t know i think it s kind of like the aftermath of you can point now at a million ways the cia fbi nsa could have busted the operation ahead of time but that doesn t mean anybody committed treason for one as it were hindsight is i e the fact it s obvious now doesn t mean it was obvious at the time second we may think that some of the indications should have been picked up on but that just means the relevant people in the government and security apparatus should have done a better job there were some indications on the night before and a few officers on the ground heeded it for example a navy officer that decided to dispatch extra patrol ships or something and probably prevented the death of a few dozen civilians on the shore but i bet similar indications were received pretty regularly in the months and years before the attack and most of the time they were false warnings']"

being born in palestine i am not a native english speaker so i am using a translator i would appreciate a response in formal english i am not trying to criticize palestine i want to address this from a woman s perspective children are dying yet women continue to give birth are these births truly the result of women s free will how many women would want to keep giving birth while witnessing their children die in a war to what extent are women s rights protected within palestine i am afraid to raise this topic because it might be seen as siding with israel or suggesting that palestine is at fault however i am still curious is giving birth continuously a form of resistance against israel or are women living under pressure to keep having children despite the deaths of children in wartime isn t there any discussion about this add i expressed concern that raising this issue might lead to responses that demonize palestine making it difficult to speak out as expected such reactions have emerged this is hardly surprising please look at how i responded to those comments i absolutely do not agree with such views on the other hand there are also comments here that i find valuable and worth considering it is your choice what to believe add since i don t know how to pin a comment i ll just copy some comments by baker this is a good and fair question and i m assuming good faith despite some pretty strange undertones in the post so i ll do my best and assume it s worth answering with both empathy and facts women giving birth in gaza right now are shaped by overlapping realities of their cultural norms individual choice medical access and the pressures of life under siege some women do see continuing to have children as an act of resilience and continuity but for many it s also about long standing traditions religious beliefs and the fact that when people are really stressed out and having nothing to do they still have sex however i think the actual statistics may surprise you a bit the data i could find from the un on this shows the reality here is far from a story of unlimited choice i ll walk through some of it as it s pretty sobering fewer births unfpa reports that in the first half of there were births in gaza this is fewer than in the same period in with one in three pregnancies now high risk newborns are born fighting if they re born at all roughly of newborns are premature underweight or in need of neonatal intensive care and there s been a more than fold increase in stillbirths compared to three years ago high risk pregnancies have increased unicef estimates that around women in gaza each year have high risk pregnancies and about of births are preterm many of these outcomes are driven by malnutrition untreated medical conditions and the collapse of the health system of hospitals are gone only a handful of maternity hospitals are still functioning and last time i checked i believe who was reporting that more than of hospitals are damaged or destroyed nevermind the limited capacity of what remains marked increase in newborn deaths fuel and supply shortages have led to over newborn deaths simply because incubators or emergency care weren t available so the un agencies have been pretty explicit in the data that women children and newborns are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the conflict both as casualties and through the loss of even the most basic reproductive healthcare so while the reasons for having children are definitely personal and varied the conditions in which those births happen are now deeply constrained and brutal in sum yes tradition survival and resistance i am sure play some limited role but the human cost is staggering and reproductive rights in gaza right now exist in a context where the choice is heavily shaped by war not just by personal will edit putting some sources as requested unfpa situation report on the crisis in the occupied palestinian territory may june

'movement']","['the pro palestinian people don t use critical thinking or have any nuanced understanding of anything they are the type of people who don t understand that both sides can do good and bad things compared to the pro israel people who tend to be far more diverse in opinions are are generally more critically supportive of israel like it s extremely common to find pro israelis who condemn the settlements or don t agree with some of the tactics of the idf where as it is very difficult to find pro palestinian who will condemn or criticize hamas or palestine in any way except for rare cases online where they pretend to be nuanced only when called out so i have a generally favorable opinion on pro israel people in the west and a very negative opinion on pro palestine people in the west and after interacting with people at pro palestine protests in toronto just reinforces my view saying anything even mildly critical about palestine in pro palestinian spaces will get you heavily ostracized', 'i m not gonna comment on the other parts they seem mostly accurate but you are partially correct in that last statement pro palestinian is indeed not necessarily an issue since that s pro a people being able to live period the problem is that what most people call pro palestinian is in fact pro palestine aka the idea of ethnically cleansing enslaving jews whether by identity or otherwise out of control of the landmass called palestine by the romans one is a people the other is a land the land is a problem and most people who follow one accidentally endorse the other this is precisely the reason those of us on the both are not good but israel is closer to neutral than bad and hamas palestinian sentiment aka the concept of again ethnically cleansing jews is definitely bad have such a problem with that movement individuals calling for certain things even if they are in power of a country do not affect anything if the power they hold does not affect the situation in question see certain ministers in israel making comments bordering on genocidal intent but not having rule of thumb over the idf the problem here is that there is even more background history to what you re talking about that even i who have been made aware of the hindparts again most people aren t am only lightly aware of one of the biggest ones was that it was not as simple as just polish nationalism though i forget what the exact cause of it was pretty sure it wasn t just one cause at any rate and calling it polish nationalism is probably simplifying it too much i don t like the term anti semitism being as it is an academic amalgamation of multiple things so let s use the term anti jewish while it is true that he was not necessarily anti zionist i do believe there was a portion of it included in there because as per usual the old saying which i do not remember the exact wording of still holds anyone who tried to consider anti jewish sentiment to be logical has consistently found themselves lacking it is not inherently reasonable and the same goes for the response to zionism even though as a jew i myself will make clear that this was a socialist ideal no matter where its roots were the simple fact is that since it was an idea espoused by jews people hated it for the fact that jews were speaking of it nothing more and whether you believe in god or not i do believe that whoever manages cause and effect was the reason that happened like i said in my previous comment some of the isolated groups actions were counter intuitive this does not make us public enemy number which is something that both n zi and pro palestine ideology have in common towards us', 'it s hard to reply when you start saying for those who truly believe israel has done little to nothing wrong because even being pro israel if you are trying to use logic and not passion or irrational arguments it s impossible to deny that israel has done a lot of things wrong and the secondary part is also ignoring so many other facts but none of them makes me believe that i should be like the mainstream pro palestine because none of their arguments are logical and shows a complete use of emotion and lack of understanding of history or even point out history from years ago and an attempt to erase history and reset by not having israel to exist in the present at all this is so absurd that i cannot ever agree with this main pro palestine view to specify i was always pro israel and indifferent to palestine having studied more about the conflict made me even more pro israel and more pro palestine at the same time i can be very critical of israel and its government decisions while also holding palestinian government accountable both pa and hamas while at the same time i want both people to exist in security and with dignity any other logic different than that it s immoral to me which is why i will never support the mainstream pro palestine movement oh by the way the main pro palestine movement loves to claim that even palestinians and gazans who are moderate and have a similar view to mine as paid zios hasbarah traitor how can i ever support people who can t listen to palestinians or gazans just because they don t agree with them so i guess this should answer your question for moral clarity i cannot and will not ever support the mainstream pro palestine movement when and if they stop asking for the erasure of jewish people and israel and stop using zio as a slur and start going towards peace i will give them a chance otherwise i will stay as far away as possible from them']"

so prone to speaking in hyperbole from the associated press the pound bomb has multiple variants some are designed to penetrate deep underground targets while others detonate above ground and cause widespread damage depending on the variant and whether the munition is dropped in an open or urban area its blast radius can be as far as a quarter mile away or a much more confined area the bombs are dumb or unguided bombs but can be turned into more precise weapons with the addition of joint direct attack munition kits or jdam kits which add a tail fin and navigation that added kit enables troops to guide the munition to a target rather than simply dropping it from a fighter jet onto the ground the kits make the weapons more precise but in a densely populated urban environment a jdam kit is not going to make much of a difference a precise hit will still have the reach to kill unintended bystanders according to cnn the us has provided more bombs than jdams and almost half of detonations were assessed as unguided furthermore the idf has used white phosphorous and lied about it so it s clear that they re a willing to use ordinance irresponsibly and b try to cover it up so there s some ambiguity but it s possible that the largest bombs are consistently equipped with guidance systems in the absence of irrefutable proof i should ve said that israel is dropping both pound bombs and unguided bombs my mistake but still not a great look for the idf where did you get those ratios they were widely reported would they take solace in the fact that their own government sacrificed their

nuclear talks are deadlocked this is not entirely correct israel s attack was wasn t actually preemtive iran attacked israel first in really it s been attacking israel indirectly for decades via proxies but that doesn t quite rise to the definition of an armed attack which would grant casus beli for a war of self defense but when iran attacked israel in its rocket salvo last year that most definitely did rise to a casus beli important to note here is that the attack by iran was a retaliation for the killing of an irgc general in syria who was there cooridinating the arming of hezbollah the fact the attack was not on iranian soil and that it conferred an immediate military benefit against an armed force israel was openly warring with makes this legally not a justification for an armed attack by iran against israel once iran has demonstrated that it is willing to directly attack israel it became strategically necessary to degrade its striking ability both israel and iran know that the way to beat israel is to saturate its superior but not unlimited defensive capability that mean manufacturing and stocking a volume of rockets that israel cannot logistically handle once that occurs israel s defensive advantage is nullified and iran s ability to threaten israel increases significantly israel has been aware of this but has not been able to afford preventing it directly because of the threat of a hezbollah counterstrike but once the threat of hezbollah was removed a strategic window opened for israel to hit iran before it could scale up beyond israel s capability to absorb the damage was expected to be significant but tolerable in a way that waiting for iran to choose the time to attack again would not be the nuclear aspect of this is the sexiest so it got a lot

constitutes genocide not the number the k bosniaks were not civilians killed while fighting an armed force even out of negligence that would be a war crime but not genocide instead they were killed while they were held in custody where they were systematically executed out of combat the was no military advantage to be gained from it the only explanation for why it happened is for the purpose of there existing fewer bosniaks that s what genocide is not the number game cont', 'is your position that israel shouldn t have attacked iran iran literally has a countdown clock in tehran to israel s

scientists iran has done none of this you can simply google any of this maybe mossad should have spent more time inflitrating hamas and stop them from launching raids into their territory either they re unable or unwilling whichever it is simply shows to me that israel isn t as invincible as they claim to be you might say hey its the element of surprise i could say the same for this attack i never would have thought that israel would do something so brazenly in violation of international norms but they did like assasins killing their enemies in their sleep in their own homes the consequence of this war will be that for the first time in years iran will no longer be funding and training terror groups to slaughter israeli civilians no it will directly shoot missiles into israeli cities instead and these won t be the cheap ass drainage pipe missiles used by hamas this is exclusively a one way street israel is crushing this terrorist regime as i said israel is merely shooting its own

history facts they are important and you should consider them before you use your bias to make such statements the yom kippur war took place from october to october egypt and syria coordinated with other arab nations a surprise attack against israel on yom kippur the holiest day in judaism when a large percentage of the israeli military was on leave and the country was observing a religious fast egypt launched a massive assault across the suez canal breaching israel s defensive bar lev line and pushing into the sinai peninsula and well into israel syria simultaneously attacked the golan heights making significant gains in the early days of the war other arab nations including iraq jordan and libya provided support with iraq sending troops and aircraft to assist syria the war resulted in heavy casualties on both sides the war ended with a ceasefire brokered at the camp david accords which led to a historic peace treaty between israel and egypt in as part of the agreement israel withdrew from the entire sinai peninsula returning it to egypt in exchange for peace however egypt refused to take back gaza which it had controlled before the six day war leaving the strip under israeli control egyptian president anwar sadat was assassinated in by the egyptian islamic jihad who opposed peace with israel', 'you re trying to frame israel s actions as some ongoing unilateral land grab but the history doesn t support your version even if it s been repeated often enough online israel has been annexing land since it was born actually israel didn t annex anything after for nearly years and most of its land in the war was gained while defending itself against five invading arab armies that war wasn t started by israel it was a response to the arab rejection of the un partition plan and a coordinated military assault meant to wipe israel off the map at birth the only land israel gave back was the sinai and only because it took it by force yes israel captured the sinai in the six day war a defensive war after egypt massed troops on the border blockaded the straits of tiran a casus belli under international law and coordinated with syria and jordan israel returned the entire sinai peninsula which is over of the land it captured in exchange for peace with egypt that wasn t just compliance with law it was the largest peaceful land for peace agreement in modern history no but they started it exception actually international law does distinguish between wars of aggression and wars of self defense if you attack a country and lose territory in the process that territory is often held as a bargaining chip for peace not as a prize but as leverage that s exactly what happened with egypt and jordan who both eventually made peace with israel and got land or recognition in return israel hasn t given a single inch back to palestine not true in israel unilaterally withdrew from gaza evacuated all settlements removed every soldier and handed the territory over to the palestinian authority what did israel get in return hamas took over kicked out the pa in a coup and launched thousands of rockets into israel that s not occupation that s what happened after israel left begin and arafat peace prizes you re mixing up events menachem begin won the nobel peace prize with anwar sadat of egypt not arafat that was for the camp david accords which returned the sinai and secured peace with egypt arafat shared a peace prize much later in with yitzhak rabin and shimon peres for the oslo accords where israel and the plo recognized each other and started a path toward a two state solution israel gave gaza the same way britain gave irgun lehi a place in africa that s a bizarre and historically baseless analogy israel s disengagement from gaza wasn t a relocation a deportation or a colonial move it was a unilateral withdrawal from territory complete with evacuating israeli civilians against their will you don t get more concrete than that', 'please know the whole story when you make such a message on day in when israel got their independence they were immediately attacked by all their arab neighbors their goal was to annihilate them the arabs in israel also went into battle war against israel so israel needed to bomb and fight back all over the place as a result mainly when israel began to win all the arab citizens ran away which they turned into extensive propaganda all over the world that they were expelled from their homes and are refugees till now instead of getting their message that this is the price you pay for starting a war during all the years until now all the arab countries constantly made statements against israel their days are numbered and we will wipe them later in the late s and s egypt expelled the un force from gaza and sinai and began massing its troops in the sinai israel reiterated declarations that any closure of the suez canal would be considered an act of war or justification for war later jordan and egypt signed a defense pact that they could win against israel the iraqi army began deploying troops and armored units in jordan egypt blocked the suez canal all because they never acknowledge the existence of israel then it exploded when israel launched a surprise air strike bombing most of the egyptian planes you can maybe blame israel for starting the war israel captured the golan heights from syria the west bank east jerusalem from jordan and the gaza strip and the sinai from egypt with all the reality israel thinks that to survive they cannot have a strip less than miles wide meaning without the west bank and the golan which has a lot of mountains is critically important from a military standpoint in israel made a package deal with egypt and offered to give back all of sinai and gaza but egypt refused to take back gaza the peace treaty was just in exchange egypt should recognize the legitimacy of israel back to gaza israel pulled out entirely from gaza in the place was then under palestinian control they got chocolate and a long strip on the beach a year later hamas whose goal is to destroy israel and kill them all came in with a legal election with eu

when hamas burned down houses with whole families including children inside them they raped tortured and murdered innocent civilians they specifically targeted civilians and intended and still intend given the fact the are still firing rockets at civilian areas in israel to maximize the amount of innocent causalities israel is targeting military targets and before they do they have given days of advance notice to civilians to get out of the areas the are bombing in order to minimize civilian casualties i would ask first if you see a moral difference between those two approaches the fact they are bombing areas where the know there are likely to still be civilians in spite of their warnings may not be ethical that is certainly an argument you could make and there is some obvious weight to that here s is one important ethical question though hamas has said that they will not stop targeting israeli civilians and killing innocents no matter what happens is israel supposed to continue to allow hamas to hide in gaza and break into israel every few months or so to terrorize civilians included the killing and torture of children like on oct th are they supposed to not protect their children if hamas isn t destroyed they will keep killing people if you value israeli children s lives as much as palestinian children s lives you have to ask the question what will ultimately lead to fewer total deaths of children and suffering of civilians letting hamas exist or eradicating them i m not saying i know the answer but in the real world the answer is not as simple as no children can be allowed to die ever as much as we all might want that there are no solutions in this conflict only trade offs', 'see you re doing it again you re making these sweeping generalizations about the political views of palestinian children which leads me to believe that israel is at the very least trying to rationalize the indifference to their deaths just leave it at israel is doing the best they can but this is urban warfare and hamas uses human shields there is absolutely no reason to talk about the political views of the civilian population unless you want me to believe that israel considers them targets there absolutely has been emphasis on the nature of the brutality of october th in order to justify the mass deaths and destruction there has been quite a bit of emphasis on it with the implication that had it been a normal attack within the bounds of international law israel would just sit back and take it they absolutely wouldn t there would be a retaliation regardless but would they kill as many civilians im led to believe that they are unable to kill fewer civilians the nature of the atrocities committed in october th are simply irrelevant to the scale of the retaliation because the retaliation should be the same either way it s like why don t you do a ceasefire you ve killed a lot of civilians and the answer is hamas committed extreme atrocities and we cant stop now it s a gray area and i understand why it is if you hold the belief that gazans cant be reformed in terms of their hatred then you re in a mentality that is truly not far from the final solution for gaza you understand why i think that right you cant start with the belief that an entire people are beyond reform indifference to their suffering combined with retaliation against militias that live there leads to a sort of passive do i need to say it i cant rule out that a lot of people in gaza just hate israel because israel simply thinks that they should just all drop dead kibbush ha avoda and the jnf wreaked economic pain on the palestinians jews before the second aliyah were part of the culture in palestine jabotnitksy said polite indifference which i take to mean we don t care what your economic experience results in due to our policies of economic exclusion i wasn t even talking about the history but everyone always has to bring it up and it s interesting but i ve rehashed it too much and i ve made a case as to why the way that zionist operated in the early th century could have been done differently in a way that didn t erupt into violence but that was then this is now you want them to apologize for believing irrationally that the zionists would displace them well the zionists did displace them so peace plans cantons enclaves continued occupation unilateral disarmament idk if you want an international organization to take control you re saying they should just take control of palestine not of israel maybe they should take over the whole thing and make everyone get along killing civilians with disproportionate force in response to an attack is a good way to make everyone both fear you but it s also a good way to make everyone hate you my two cents', 'or do you think palestinians are less than human and should be held to a lower standard i thought we talk about hamas not palestinians in general or you maybe think hamas palestinians if there was a wear between two regular armies i e palestine vs israel then you could say so but this is not the case here hamas is not a regular army some even call them terror group netanyahu called them sick animals or sth like that so why setting such a high standards now israel s regular army should respect international law but they obviously don t which is much more shocking and sick they have been quoted multiple times stating how civilian deaths are how they hope to pressure israel do show me where they said they want more civilians killed hoping that international community will pressure israel because it kills too many civilians does not equal wanting lots of your own civilians getting killed can t you see the difference hamas hopes and counts on israel not to strike civilian targets but israel does it anyways that s why they are accused of war crimes that is using civilians as human shields and the only way it makes them not easy targets is because it makes them harder to discriminate them from civilians again it s israeli army that is ready to strike civilian objects and kill civilians as collateral damage no one forces israel to do that and it was idf that used palestinians as human shields on tank it was even recorded on video but i bet you will call it isolated incident as you usually do when it comes to israel then you should be against hamas using violent means pick one nah we saw that when palestinians tried peaceful way without any violence for example under abbas israel simply continued building illegal settlements and building wall so this didn t bring palestinians anywhere armed resistance is therefore necessary as a part of effort to show israel that there will be no peace until they get a state mind you i said a part i think combination of initial armed resistance and later via negotiations is the only way didn t israel also resort to radical movements even terror tactics irgun back then when they were fighting for their own state i do believe that the path to get ss involves both sides making concessions though']"

inflating numbers and they say k and that likely includes deaths by natural causes i agree there s possibly more fog of war and all that but best available evidence is k and your argument that we don t know the true figure applies to every conflict hence nullifying it here for example to this day the number of civilans deaths caused by coaltion forces in the iraq war varies from k to k violent civilian deaths caused by the iraq war are estimated at closer to k the higher figures are based on the increased mortality rates from the collapse of the country and the violence caused by the resulting instability to compare with gaza we d have to calculate how many die over the next few years as a result of the bombing campaign massive amounts of asbestos spread everywhere unexploded munitions long term effects of disease starvation and dehydration later deaths from the tens of thousands of serious injuries sustained to date the homelessness inflicted on over a million people and everything else we don t know that figure yet i do think it should be compared to iraq in the regard but at the moment it isn t an equivalent comparison not true the un eu and other sources estimate that civilians usually account for percent to percent of casualties or a ratio in modern war though this does mix all types of wars if you go and look at the actual report it takes that from they re even using previous israeli palestinian conflicts as the source it s not here s a time when france destroyed an entire city with missiles and killed ten civilians for every militant and everyone applauded it s a collection of war crimes in the battle of mosul a battle supervised by the u s that used the world s most powerful airpower resources some civilians were killed compared to roughly isis terrorists the figures from mosul attributed about a third of the deaths to each side of the conflict and the remaining third undetermined the conservative estimate there would be none of that plausibly prooves genocidal intent and its dolus specialis standard no it doesn t which is why i said it isn t proven that some strikes may have been revenge based or reckless or intended to force population movements does not prove genocidal intent it would if enough of them were conducted for those purposes but we don t know and likely never will barring some major investigation along the lines of the review into the nato bombing campaign in yugoslavia that leaves us with the argument that israel haven t been proven to have committed genocide but those who claim it are speculating based on an at least somewhat plausible set of assumptions finally the obvious which is that israel is clearly fighting a just war given october th it has the right and perhaps even the oblgiation to remove hamas from power to nullify a clear and present and serious security threat fighting defensively justifies the decision to war it doesn t justify conduct in the war if ukraine had taken back all of their territory in a single day and then spent nine months bombing moscow and st petersburg into rubble while of the russian population was evacuated to siberia we wouldn t say that their conduct is beyond reproach because russia started it or because of bucha or because putin refuses to surrender we would rightly condemn any unnecessary killing or devastation imho the argument that israel is unduly targeting civilans just enough to have plausible deniability is pretty weak you could make that argument about any war and it s an argument purely based on plausibiltiy and not evidence i d say it s actually stronger here than in most recent examples we can see the considerable amount of open hatred and dehumanisation coming from the israeli populace and government some of which is so severe it clearly amounts to a call to genocide we know that a majority of the population would be willing to starve the civilian population of gaza to death by blocking all humanitarian aid we have tens of thousands of airstrikes on civilian structures without any clear information on who or what was targeted we have clear examples of idf soldiers killing people who posed no conceivable threat as with the surrendering israeli hostages we have a disregard for life so severe that it enables the use of human shields to check for mines and traps with the obvious implication being that the lives of those civilians are considered to lack value we have the prison and detention system that has become so brutal it has effectively implemented systematic abuse and torture despite the system itself later deigning at least a third of the detainees to have been civilians we also have a deliberate blanket policy of refusing access to journalists and of refusing neutral parties access to inspect prison facilities all of that combined it s not a stretch to speculate that israeli troops on the ground may well have committed genocide through random undisclosed and unjustified killings', 'notice that this number is the end figure and not the figures in the fog of war which are the numbers that we re seeing currently the point isn t that the numbers we see right now are accurate i pointed out that they aren t and that is to be expected the inconsistency is a product of the difficulty to report accurate information not necessarily that the numbers are faked the past accuracy of reporting lends some credence to the numbers being reported as accurately as currently possible and in good faith this is by no means definitive of course so we can corroborate the reported numbers with other data such as the number of destroyed buildings to get a larger picture another thing that s lacking from this is the crucial difference in who is a militant and who is not something that the numbers of the health ministry don t provide now and something that the estimates that they gave after previous wars were different than the un and israel s estimations as per the un s analysis of the conflict u n researchers start out with figures from the ministry the media and other sources but then cross check them with the help of palestinian israeli and international human rights groups the u n s overall number of killed is slightly higher than that of the gaza health ministry the u n said nearly percent of the total or were civilians defined as those who didn t take part in hostilities and were not members of armed groups source your point is sort of irrelevant when of those killed were determined to be civilians as per the un that being said determining whether someone was or was not a militant is difficult since it requires witness accounts or local community knowledge the current numbers we see indicate significant numbers of child and women casualties which are obviously not militants if we are killing children simply because hamas is using them as human shields i don t understand how that is in any way justifiable it would imply we know children will die before we drop the bomb and we don t care as long as we get a couple militants in the process besides even if it was true in the past it doesn t really answer op s analysis perhaps in this current conflict when the complete destruction of hamas is on the table it acts differently op s analysis is invalid there is no question to answer as another comment pointed out the variance in the numbers is more consistent with the data being batched and reported than being faked op basically just took the numbers at face value in a vacuum and concluded they are fake with no corroborating evidence context as usual is very important i am for the complete destruction of hamas i m not in favor of the complete destruction of gaza which is what is currently happening let s be generous and say that at the end of the conflict hamas is gone what is left for the civilians to return to the largest population center gaza city is essentially in ruins', 'the un is lying about of gaza deaths are women and children tldr summary the un picked some sample to make conclusions when there is a sample from the same source that shows the ratio of casualties that are women and children is i was highly surprised to see the recent spat of articles coming out like this supporting the un s claim that near of the gaza dead are women and children why because they are lying from the article the un s human rights office has condemned the high number of civilians killed in the war in gaza saying its analysis shows close to of verified victims over a six month period were women and children the un agency said it verified the details of people killed in gaza from november to april its analysis found around of verified victims were children and women remember the un uses numbers from the gaza health ministry fta gaza s hamas run health ministry whose figures the un sees as reliable notice they are basing this on counting details of deaths in a period between november and april however we already have many previously published sources even through the un about analysis of a much larger quantity of deaths take this article from may the u n humanitarian agency citing gaza s health ministry says children and women were killed in gaza as of april the u n says gaza s health ministry has been able to fully identify deaths out of more than people the ministry says have been killed in the gaza strip or this article with updated tracking through august the gaza ministry of health moh has released a new detailed list of gazans reportedly killed in the ongoing war since october marking a significant improvement in the accuracy and quality of casualty reporting the report covering deaths between october and august in terms of demographics the new list closely mirrors the april report of the deaths recorded are children under are adults between and and are elderly individuals over in these articles from may and october we can see the of deaths that are women and children is not near perspective i analyzed the moh numbers a month ago and estimated the civilian militant casualty ratio is to if we used the un s false numbers we would end up with a ratio of to those aren t close to each other the latter would be much more indicative of indiscriminate bombing than the former for reference if the number of women children was of the casualties the ratio would be near to which would be in line with most wars that are not even in such a dense urban environment what is the un doing i have no idea did they cherry pick this sample from the that have been accounted for in a way to make the numbers look worse is this an additional people on top of that even in that case the total numbers would only bring the women and children to maybe these are

hadn t attacked for years and offered peace to lebanon several times the lebanese flag lit up tel aviv city hall after a port explosion all grandstanding don t you realize how the jews operate ok but hezbollah attacked with rockets israel told it for months to stop without invading and hezbollah refused isn t that provocation that was not israel s fault hassan nasrallah knew that israel was attempting to invade anyway ok but then why is it then when told to leave this alone by every lebanese sect he refused and said that the rockets would not stop unless gaza was left alone we have to stand with our brothers in palestine the same ones that massacred you so often in the s that your parents threw rice at israel when it entered lebanon ancient history ok but if netanyahu unequivocally stated that the objective was only to stop the rockets and hassan nasrallah guaranteed they would never stop no matter what unless gaza was left alone that would imply whoever broke their word lost

assault on the jewish state lie the target of israel s airstrike in damascus was a diplomatic facility false the notion that the target of the damascus airstrike was a mere iranian consulate is laughable the building was a local headquarters of the iranian revolutionary guard corps irgc a branch of the iranian military that has been designated as a terrorist organization by the united states and multiple other countries those killed were senior figures in the irgc including brigadier general mohammad reza zahedi a senior commander in the irgc s foreign operations unit who was responsible for liaising with hezbollah and his deputy general mohammad hadi hajriahim five other irgc officers were killed in the airstrike as were five iranian affiliated militiamen one hezbollah operative one iranian military advisor and two apparent civilians the airstrike was aimed at military figures in a military facility and the targets were directly involved in orchestrating attacks on israel the fact that the building was adjacent to the iranian embassy does not change its military character lie israel carried out the damascus airstrike in order to provoke a wider war false for months israel has limited its military response to the ongoing assault by iranian proxy groups to tit for tat airstrikes and artillery fire directly targeting the sources of the attacks the reality however is that large swaths of northern israel have been uninhabitable due to the ongoing hezbollah attacks which are being directed by the group s patron iran the only way to force hezbollah to stop its assault on northern israel and restore calm is to target the iranian military officials behind the attacks that is what the damascus airstrike was intended to do to end the impunity enjoyed by iranian military officials as they oversee ongoing attacks targeting the people of israel lie any israeli response will cause the situation to escalate further false the unprecedented iranian assault on israel which involved hundreds of missiles and drones was the escalation it has been roundly condemned around the world israel will respond to this unparalleled act of aggression as any sovereign country would not least in order to deter the iranian regime from carrying out further attacks against israeli territory and send the message that israel will not tolerate massive attacks on its sovereign territory by a foreign state lie the relatively limited damage from the iranian attack means it s no big deal and israel should let it go false the iranian assault was absolutely unprecedented in its scope and

israel the americans and the brits did with the balfour declaration why it s easy access into the middle east and it s easy destabilization of the area for easy oil profits ofcourse getting israel along with the state solution was never enough need the whole pie right i assure you jews would have preferred getting judea and somaria i assure you that no matter how much land was given to the zionists it was never going to be enough and the balfour declaration and the creation of israel was a big mistake all of this was by design to spark a permanent and never ending war between the jews israelis and the arabs edit for some reason i can t reply to you think the balfour declaration was about oil this was years before oil was discovered on the arabian peninsula so nope edit the massive oil deposits that the middle east is known for were discovered by saudi arabia in it was this discovery that transformed the middle east actually it was discovered by americans what a coincidence yes there were some oil deposits in iran that the british had discovered in less than a decade before the balfour declaration but this was a very small proportion of the worlds known oil deposits at the time considering it had only just been discovered in addition there was little to suggest there was more oil in the region and consensus at the time in fact also suggested that there was no oil in the arabian peninsula source the consensus looks like some mighty fine spook work to me there just ain t no conceivable way george bernard reynolds said you know what guys it s pointless so let s just pack up and leave that s coincidence in any case the idea that the balfour declaration could be due to oil is one of the most ahistorical theories i have ever seen you are seemingly basing this on some oil deposits which were almost kilometres away from israel palestine in a country with a completely different ethnic group persians are not arabs iran had actually been on decent terms with israel prior to the revolution and on oil deposits that the british owned anyway so it doesn t really make sense to destabilise the region if that was even happening that ain t the only big steaming pile of shit the brits left behind their other fine works includes the in india pakistan split all kinds of shit shows in africa hong kong and a few well planted spats in asia israel palestine just happens to be their biggest hit and secondly the super convenient shipping routes from israel to the strait of gibraltar is all happenstance right the brits and americans just happened to land on the gold mine of a shipping route what a beautiful ugly coincidence depends whom you ask right ding ding ding we got a coincidence jackpot i mean it all screams like a nice and convenient oil route to me which it is all the big steaming piles of shit actually happen to be important resource extraction locations like ports if this pattern wasn t there then you d be right on my theory being absurd but all of it points towards important ports and important resource locations like it was by design which it is and finally nice job of using block reply so nobody can present any counter arguments now another edit for you need to improve your knowledge of the history here the balfour declaration didn t create israel i mean it s right there the balfour declaration was a public statement issued by the british government in during the first world war announcing its support for the establishment of a national home for the jewish people in palestine then an ottoman region with a small minority jewish population well well well it s basically israel without actually spelling israel that was in at this time there were already tens of thousands of jews living in palestine already hard at work draining swamp creating arable land etc then in the league of nations voted on and passed a resolution to create such a homeland naming the british as administrators of the mandate while the division of land was to be negotiated while the arabs continued to reject any land at all going to the jews the jews continued to build and agree to multiple proposed partitions all sponsored by wealthy groups like rothschild it wasn t all organic and natural at all it was planned executed perfectly for the shipping route from israel to the strait of gibraltar this is the problem with learning history from tiktok and youtube activists they throw out references to things but no one bothers to actually learn about them says the person who gets their history from spook org i mean the pattern is clear as day western interests are to not let anyone have a firm foothold in the middle east and that includes israel the arabs the muslims the russians literally anyone except themselves they want it to be a hot sauce sandbox forever just like asia and europe i mean the way the partitions were handled they were screaming for a civil war until the end of times israelis do have the correct idea of a permanent solution for their stability which is ethnic cleansing yeah i know it s morally crap and i m obviously against this horrible plan as that s the only way they re ever going to stop it and you ll see the west being against it and all the other means which allows israel or anyone else to get a firm handle on the situation it was always about the oil and neo colonialism by design israel s never gonna win and all the rugs will be pulled from under their feet when the signs of them winning are clear', 'yeah cause the region that contained palestine was ruled by the f king ottoman empire for years then the british defeated them in ww in with the help of hussein and his arab revolt against the empire and a jewish spy ring nili the british agreed with him in documented letters in that they would recognize an independent arab state and defer to his territory terms if he staged a revolt his terms clearly laid out that he expected the region of palestine to be made part of that state he is very clear in the letters that he is unwilling to support the british in defeating the ottoman empire side by side unless they could clearly agree to his proposed boundaries meanwhile the british went behind his back and created a secret treaty with france italy and russia at the time before they got got where they partitioned out all that land among themselves sykes picot agreement the british always wanted their own project in the middle east since both france and russia held power in middle eastern regions through the catholic and orthodox churches britain felt left out they cared so very little for the humanitarian reasons for settling jews in palestine they wanted to further british policy it s literally in theodore herzl s diaries the british were also writing to one another heh heh the arabs won t actually build a state they aren t strong enough don t take it serious be vague about the terms while also coming out with balfour declaration saying they would support an establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine lol this was of course after the british failed to resettle jewish people in uganda you wanna know one of the big reasons why the british jumped to give the balfour declaration to rothschild and publicize it i do not think it is possible to exaggerate the international power of the jews british officials wrote to each other they believed that the support of world jewry would be significant to further their aims in the war yep antisemitism and a classic colonial lust for power is what drove the british to offer palestine on a platter and trust hussein reached out to the british like yo wtf is this i thought we agreed that that region was for the arab state and they fucking lied and told him that clearly the ottoman empire made up the declaration to turn him against them they assured him that the turks were messing with him and they wouldn t even think of doing such a thing so he helped them defeat the ottoman empire and when they continued to seize and occupy land after arabs knew something was up and hussein knew that they intended to violate their agreement they did and this dude refused to sign any treaties after that versailles sevres etc even when the british offered him for his signature and for him to recognize the balfour declaration ya know the one they told him wasn t real he stood his ground and said no that he would not as a leader consent to the handing over of palestine that he never agreed to so what did the british do the withdrew their support of him and funded his rival saud and told him reaaal sorry youre getting attacked man why don t you recognize the declaration and we can help you out he said no saud armed by the british went on to conquer hussein s kingdom and exiled him effectively getting him outta the way the imperial powers stole the land from the people who lived there and handed it out promised it to a nation of people with no regard for the consent of the governed clearly this is the craziest cliff notes but yeah', 'that being said i find a lot of you comments misleading and inaccurate ok and here s your first assertion after this they actually did try numerous times that was the entire reason there was a british mandate for palestine this is misleading as the discussion is about the creation of an arab state side by side with the jewish state at the dissolution of mandatory palestine on may you re implying that jews blocked the creation of an arab state alongside theirs which is incorrect arguably to this day they kinda did though previous the the balfour declaration there were the mcmahon hussein correspondence these were correspondence in in which britain stated they would recognize arab independence if they helped them the arabs helped the british maps were draw as to what land would be allowed for arab independence the british accepted the boundaries which included palestine first mcmahon actually added conditional language to his commitment to hussein that specifically acknowledged the sizable non arab population in the region the districts of mersina and alexandretta and portions of syria lying to the west of the districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo cannot be said to be purely arab and must on that account be excepted from the proposed limits and boundaries furthermore and ironically palestine appears to only have been specifically and directly referenced in documented british promises to the jews balfour declaration and the league of nations mandate for palestine itself regardless on may both britain and the un abandoned the jews and never enforced their promises jews had to declare their own independence and defend their own brand new state from the day one invasion of arab countries you re not incorrect that the jewish state did not inherently involve the theft of arab lands but that s not how the arab s took it land that the british had promised to them was now being given to another group of the land was offered to of the population they saw this as a theft especially when they only owned less than of land the justification was to make room for holocaust survivors the arab league did not believe they should have to sacrifice land for something which they were not involved in they believed jews should be given refuge in countries that were fighting against the nazis beyond this there were also issues with the jewish state having control of the vital water supplies and land on a majority of citrus farms and all of the most fertile lands any qualms arabs may have had with the deal should ve been negotiated via diplomacy if they wanted to negotiate borders the way to do that was at a deal table and not on the battlefield maybe it was hubris that they outnumbered the jews maybe it was the commitment of several arab nations to come in and destroy israel before it got off the ground deciding to fight instead of talk opened up the arabs to lots of unfortunate consequences just to add a bit of context the overall arab league consisting of egypt jordan syria lebanon iraq saudi arabia and yemen rejected it there was a lot of inter conflict in the group each monarch or leader had their own political agenda for example egypt wanted palestine to not be an independent state but to become a part of egypt unknown to the arab league jordan was working with the jewish agency to come to a counter agreement given the involvement of all of these surrounding arab nations was this truly about the establishment of an independent palestinian state for a distinct group or was this about preventing a jewish state so all of the land could be absorbed into these states after all from to both gaza and the west bank were under egyptian and jordanian control respectively yet arabs continued to try to destroy israel and never made any serious attempt at the creation of an independent palestine it s very disingenuous to categorize this as a self inflicted wound primary because this wasn t the palestinians war it was the arab league very few were involved what happened to the palestinians was a direct result of the actions of the arab league which they were not a part of furthermore israel s refusal to allow the palestinians to return to their homes after they fled because they did not want to be involved is incredibly important israel instead gave the homes to jews of destroyed them this is on israel this sounds a lot like was committed by hamas gazans are innocent of gazans weren t even alive to vote for hamas can you please provide compelling evidence that demonstrates that palestinian arabs were not on board with the arab league s invasion it s completely unrealistic to expect israel to unconditionally allow the return of arabs after a war that threatened its very existence']"

of this has been happening for years torture and rape you are implying is a systematic thing which is completely untrue there are very few accounts of this happening ever from the israeli side if when it has happened it is individuals a tiny minuscule proportion of the idf that s not to say it s ok but of course in every country and army you will have one or two people here and there who do terrible things i hope ofc they are brought to justice nonetheless but it s not a systematic thing at all i m confident there were more women raped by hamas on oct than there have been by the idf in the last years you might claim that s incorrect but idc there s so little evidence for any rape cases at all and same goes for torture you re then saying what israel has been doing for years is far worse than oct firstly don t you dare pretend like oct is the only crime ever committed by palestinians they ve had scores of massacres they ve done oct esque things way more times than this was just the worst example furthermore what youre saying is like saying slapping someone once each day for a year is worse than chopping off their finger once oct was by far one of the worst single skirmishes ever as far as i know in global history it was disgusting savage barbaric and shocking how proud the people doing such awful things were people proudly filming them executing civilians defiling corpses raping literally cutting an unborn child out of its mother s womb there aren t words in any language that can describe this that takes so much more inhumanity than even a century of occupation and political oppression you dare claim that the hostages weren t mistreated tell me will you admit you re lying or are you so misled you can believe this garbage they were ffing hostages beaten and bloodied and dragged out of their homes i know some of them have stood and smiled at the exchange and looked good n happy but would you not do exactly what you re told if you knew your captors still held your friends and family knowing if you disobeyed they would kill them do you really think hamas are not evil enough to take hostages and mistreat them we ve all seen the oct footage of all the rape and murder etc not a chance in hell they d treat a single one of the hostages with any amount of human kindness and you have the gall to say hamas fighters would throw themselves in front of israeli fighters to save the lives of the hostages you think for a second this would ever happen you must withdraw all of what you said it s absolute lies and either you know it and you are saying it to dishonestly push your agenda or you are a complete brainless idiot to believe such ridiculousness and you mention candace owens a disgusting antisemite who spreads gross anti jew conspiracy theories online and you are thankful for her you sir madam are an antisemite', 'yet another fake rape claims by palestinians this time it backfired so they admit it was faked as many of you probably know ever since the un started investigating and eventually found clear and credible reports about sexual violence by hamas in october as reported for example by times of israel abc news and even anti israeli orgs like the bbc the pro palestinian side felt the pressure to blame israel of the things they are guilty of as such a fake investigation was started spearheaded by antisemitic actors such as reem asalem and francesca albanese i will not go into detail about that since user did a fantastic job lately at exposing the hilarious hypocrisy lack of any evidence and lies of it all well now as their earlier attempt of a modern day blood libel failed al jazeera tried another go at it using a lying testimony from the current shifa operation which apparently hinged about a fake testimony of a palestinian woman and from there the lie went to al terrorists jazeera from there to social media where many additional fake reports embellished in more stories and details all complete lies but the effect took unprecedented turn instead of just more unjustified hate to israel it also caused palestinians who believed their own people s lies to flee the north and middle of the strip south something very bad for hamas who can t let go of their human shields so suddenly a day later those lies are being retracted this sort of thing has been happening for years now the palestinians make up lies so the world will attack the evil zionists and while it works it also does damage to themselves in plenty of ways well now al jazeera removed all records of the accusation that idf soldiers committed acts of rape here is what former al jazeera managing director wrote on x it was revealed through hamas investigations that the story of the rape of women in was fabricated of course the enemy did not hesitate to commit the crime of genocide the woman who spoke about rape justified her exaggeration and incorrect talk by saying that the goal was to arouse the nation s fervor and brotherhood as if more than thirty thousand martyrs ninety thousand wounded about a million displaced people and comprehensive destruction were not enough from an article from jpost about the whole thing although the qatari mouthpiece has yet to officially refer to the retraction all content related to the allegation has been deleted after more than hours of letting the story run freely qatari mouthpiece al jazeera deleted the page featuring their former story which accused israeli soldiers of allegedly perpetrating rape against women during the idf s latest excursion against hamas and islamic jihad terrorists who barricaded themselves inside the former hospital cum terror headquarters at shifa hospital what is seen here is a classic example of how palestinian propaganda works make up a lie run with it and spread it around the world using billions of antisemites in social media then admit it was a lie quietly and now for the real question will lie number by so called pro palestinians cause the same people who believed it to wait the next time lies are being spread about israel or will they yet again swallow the vile blood libels without question i think anyone sane knows the answer', 'do you even read these this is why zionist propaganda is so effective cus people just read titles and dont dig into the actual content let s get right to the nitty gritty what is the actual evidence what are the names of the actual victims regarding your first source patten s visit was not even a formal un investigation and her report presents no new evidence it is conspicuously vague on specifics and it even admits to being based almost entirely on israeli government and military sources the report itself even concedes that the un team was unable to establish the prevalence of sexual violence and concludes that the overall magnitude scope and specific attribution of these violations would require a fully fledged investigation patten even admits in it that israel has consistently refused to cooperate with independent un investigators and probably most importantly patten and her team were unable to locate a single victim and did not speak to any alleged survivors of sexual violence or rape despite making a public appeal for such survivors to come forward and speak confidentially and with assurances of safety and privacy but even regardless of all this patten s report claims that there are reasonable grounds to believe rape took place during the october events and she bases this conclusion on circumstantial information which she claims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence absolutely and completely vague non information it s all blah blah with zero actual evidence bottom line is there has not been identified any specific victim nor any video or forensic evidence corroborating that rape took place regarding your second source i ask again do you even read these human rights watch was not able to gather verifiable information through interviews with survivors of or witnesses to rape during the assault on october and there is only one public account reportedly from such a survivor human rights watch sent a detailed information request to the israeli government specifically focused on sexual and gender based violence asking to interview individuals employed by the israeli government who might have relevant information and to review relevant documents and images in the possession of the israeli authorities it did not receive a substantive response to this request human rights watch attempted to identify and contact survivors of and witnesses to acts of sexual and gender based violence committed during the october assault researchers were able to make contact with several people who had described their experiences witnessing acts of sexual violence to the media but who did not agree to be interviewed by human rights watch jesus and your rd source is just parroting what your first source reported that s how the zionist propaganda machine works just regurgitate unsubstantiated hearsay from someone with authority with absolutely zero actual evidence to back it up you repeat it

citizens were segregated by race and there were different sets of rights for citizens depending on their race israeli citizens have equal rights of israelis are muslim and they have rights and freedoms you could never dream of in a muslim country', 'i can t tell whether you misrepresented article ii out of deliberate dishonesty or simple ignorance but it s unfortunate that you feel the need to resort to such tactics this doesn t come across as a good faith discussion from the un article defines the crime of apartheid which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern africa you stopped mid sentence either you did not understand the text or you chose to cut the clause that decides the issue that is not honest argument here is the line you clipped with the part you left out in bold for the purpose of the present convention the term the crime of apartheid which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern africa shall apply to the following inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them that is the test a regime of domination the intent to keep it in place and the listed inhuman acts not annexation not citizenship conduct two items from article ii are directly on point and you left them out ii c exclusion from political social economic and cultural life including denial of the right to a nationality and the right to freedom of movement and residence ii d measures that divide the population into separate reserves and ghettos and expropriation of landed property south africa implemented policies against the south african people not an extraterritorial area if israel were to annex the west bank that would fit the un definition no annexation and citizenship do not appear in article ii international law attaches to effective control south africa already tried the move you are leaning on it carved out the bantustans stripped national citizenship and claimed the system was outside its responsibility the world rejected that legal fiction and the convention is written to pierce it if there is an institutionalized regime of domination an intent to maintain it and the listed acts the crime is made out whether the map lines were redrawn or not if you want the parallel criminal law definition the rome statute states it plainly an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other committed with the intention of maintaining that regime no annexation caveat there either and under icerd article racial includes national or ethnic origin the citizenship wordplay does not change the analysis a quick legal point occupation law and the apartheid crime are different bodies of law one regulates the conduct of an occupier the other punishes a domination regime they can apply at the same time control without incorporation does not insulate a system that meets the elements of article ii the jim crow laws in america are most analogous jim crow is a history lesson not the standard the standard is elements do you have an institutionalized regime systematic domination and an intent to preserve it plus acts like political exclusion restrictions on movement and residence segregation into separate areas and expropriation of land if yes it fits that is what the text says when you quote all of it not just the half that helps you', 'that s a great question apartheid in it s original meaning explicitly referred to the legal racial segregation in south africa from to a system of discrimination and exploitation that unfairly penalized south africans on account of race it is similar to jim crow in that both refer to specific periods of legal racial discrimination within a single country nowadays people typically use the word to refer to the general practice of legal discrimination against a subset of people as you quoted perhaps those people don t need even to be citizens as you say but there does need to be a legal means by which the discrimination takes place occupation is a very different practice though there are a few similarities that stand out occupation refers to the military intervention a country exerts into a foreign territory not within its borders the actual length of time can very wildly from days to decades but a military occupation is always intended to be impermanent people living under a military occupation are still subject to the laws of their own territories the west bank has a palestinian authority that governs it s people they are not subject to the laws of the occupying power because they are not citizens the occupying power may exert influence over their lives and will likely treat them very differently than their own citizens but that is to be expected that treatment might resemble apartheid because it is discriminatory but it is extremely different at its core the difference ultimately comes down to israel s goals and strategy broadly speaking israel s justification for the extended military occupation is security given the history of conflict in the region it is an understandable stance if you believe that israel started every war it has ever been in maybe you would disagree but then we would have to back up and to agree on basic facts since the goal of the occupation is security israel maintains a military presence as long as there is credible chance of a threat occuring the implication is that israel would not need to continue the occupation if there was no genuine expectations of a security risk as it stands today that seems unlikely but israel doesn t want to be expending it s resources on military occupation it does so out of necessity for the protection of it s citizens for the system to be apartheid we are missing one crucial factor annexation if israel annexed the entire west bank and gaza and then continued to treat the palestinians living there as second class citizens they would do so through legal means codified discriminatory laws policies and practices and we could rightfully call them apartheid israel is in fact a state where laws exist and generally govern behavior the people living in israel are subject to these laws people living under israeli military occupation are not subject to israeli laws because they are not living in israel every country has the responsibility to protect it s citizens countries that fail to do so usually don t end up sticking around for a tiny country like israel it is especially vital that it figures out how to protect it s citizens effectively and

want israel to exist as they have shown many times and with many wars israel has actively worked for decades to find peaceful solutions with its neighbors it has won land in defensive military operations and then given that land back as an attempt towards peace this is one of the reasons why egypt and israel have good relations now it has come to the table for peace talks negotiations many times and with sincere efforts only to be pushed back into a defensive position by wars and intifadas i don t know you and i won t assume your beliefs but if you believe this tiny country is truly as evil as people say why has it been so successful how has it been able to survive despite all the wars and aggression how has it turned the once barren wasteland of the desert into a lush garden how has it produced technological advancements at the forfront of medical science computer and so many other fields these are not the achievements of a society built on apartheid and hateful discrimination as these things are inherently unstable this is what happens when a society thrives and it s people are healthy safe and united israel is not responsible for the citizens of another country or territory it has the general responsibility that every country has not to harm needlessly but from israel s perspective it is doing what it must do to keep it s citizens safe have you seen how vitriolic just the people on reddit can be regarding israel these are people that believe wholeheartedly that the country has no right to exist that it should be disbanded somehow and who cares what happens to its citizens imagine how much more hatred fuels the extremist ideologies that lead people to strap bombs to their chests and blow up civilian bus stations imagine how much extremism and hatred has to exist for that behavior to be not only normalized but glorified and financially incentivized if we want to solve problems in the real world we need to look at reality israel does exist and doesn t plan on going anywhere if you want it to not exist you will have to destroy it it has the right to protect itself but even if you don t think it has that right it will defend itself regardless the only real question that remains is when will the palestinian leadership accept this fact and come to terms with a peaceful solution']"

to do a more covert op type of situation or would that take too long and obviously with hostages time is of the essence especially with many of them who are very young or very old also islam is the second biggest religion in the world judaism is definitely a minority which is probably why it doesn t receive as much attention obviously i m not going to say everybody who practices islam is extreme however i know that there is a deep hatred towards jewish people even christian people that derives from islam obviously there are muslims who live within israel and do just fine however my grandpa fled from the middle east because he was catholic and was constantly threatened by the muslim community he was granted asylum in the united states and a jewish american family took him in and they were so lovely to him they did not care at all that he was catholic they were just happy he was safe however one of my dear friends here is from a muslim country she fled because she questioned the religion and her brother wanted to do an honor killing due to her being atheist her friends who immigrated here are also from muslim countries but if she mentions her story or what she was taught about jews she is shunned by her friends i feel bad for her because she escaped her country to come to a westernized country just to be shunned and silenced once again by fellow muslims or woke people she told me that in school as a young child she had classes solely dedicated to hating jews and how to eradicate them she never believed this but the fact that she can t talk about this openly without fear of being disowned by her friends is sad do you think there is any hope for this problem antisemitism seems to spread like a deadly cancer as even my european and african friends who have no relation to the middle east have jumped on the anti semitic bandwagon without knowing the indoctrination that is within some muslim countries to hate jews', 'ahmed zewail pioneered femtochemistry

'themselves']","['the israeli attitude of there s nothing called palestinian in my opinion is also very damaging people are just repeating what arabs said themselves this is palestinian arab leader zuheir mohsen in there is no differences between jordanians palestinians syrians and lebanese between jordanians palestinians syrians and lebanese there are no differences we are all part of one people the arab nation just for political reasons we carefully underwrite our palestinian identity because it is of national interest for the arabs to advocate the existence of palestinians to balance zionism yes the existence of a separate palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons here is hamas leadership saying a similar thing the place was called ottoman syria before the british arrived ottoman syria was divided into several arab countries and a small jewish one arabs then tried to genocide the jews multiple times including ethnically cleansing the jews from their lands and sending them to israel the conflict has been going on since then it doesn t mean that there weren t arabs living there when israel was established but the palestinian identity was created in the s for tactical reasons by the arab definition even jews are palestinians they try to get around that by claiming the the jews aren t the real jews by your definition arabs genocided the babylonian jews and other jewish groups most israelis are descended from those refugees', 'palestinians are not just arabs one of the most frustrating issues i see all the time in israeli palestinian discourse is the denying of the palestinian identity and existence yes palestinians are arabs but we aren t only arabs noone is only arab as an identity arab is pretty much too vague to be useful for anything morrocans mauritanians palestinians and saudis are all arab and yet they share practically nothing alike sure they speak arabic but morrocan arabic is mutually unintelligible with many other dialects sure they are all mostly muslim but their are many christians communities who are just as arab their is much much more in common between say british and americans than between all arab communities and ofcourse palestinian as an identity is new but that s obvious arabs in general didn t know borders nevermind borders drawn by western colonialists instead people identified with their region or village or tribe or family yes they were arabs but even back then they wouldn t identify as js arab however when the borders where enforced and suddenly a person of the same tribe or village lived a completely different life to smeone on the other side of the same border a palestinian now has a completely different struggle to a jordanian even if they were literal cousins and so it no longer made sense to identify with you re village tribe etc although village and tribal identity still very much plays a part it made much more sense to identify with you re fellow people who had the same oppressor and so the palestinian identity grew and in the same way every arab identity grew an saudi and a kuwaiti are new identities born out of the fact that their material reality their leaders wealth and everything else is different sure they could be brothers but they now lived in different countries and so identified differently their wasn t a palestinian identity necessarily but their was a wider levantine identity aswell as smaller tribal identities which was cut and joined to make a lebanese identity a jordanian identity a syrian identity etc it s not that palestinians aren t a separate but still included people from the rest of arabs it s js that due to geopolitics and many other factors they ve identified differently and so in modern times the people who lived in modern plstn isrl call themselves palestinian to call them simply arab is not only to tell others what they should identify themselves as but also intentionally ignores the long history of the people who have resided their for centuries palestinians are a distinct people who didn t migrate from arabia tl dr palestinian is a new identity born out of new circumstances sure but it s an identity that exists and its people are distinct and unique and not just arabs', 'i m genuinely trying to understand what you mean when you say you find it offensive to hear that palestinians came from arabia and colonized this land what i said here was a response to the title of this post i m just poking fun at it i don t get offended by it if anything it s quite understandable to think so i m just saying it s false i m jewish around generations rooted in this land my family lived here for centuries side by side with arabs and l ve never denied their presence but the historical record is pretty clear arab presence in this region began with a seventh century conquest the modern palestinian identity as a distinct national group only formed in the twentieth century especially after the s with the creation of the plo and became more politically solidified in the s i think i made it clear in the comment i linked that not all arabs are the same arab is a really broad term sudanese arabs and syrian arabs are not the same yes the arab conquest happened in the th century but there is a difference between arab arabized and semi arabs palestinians are ancestors of the cannites and it s well known and i ve linked proof with my original comment although it s true a good percentage of modern palestinian identity was formed in the s but it s mainly them abandoning their identity for a pan arabist one it s clear that at the beginning that palestinian state hood was only for arab nationalism and it happened across the arab world too when i say arab sudan isn t the first thing that comes to mind yet look at their flag it s literally the pan arabist flag tldr not all arabs are the same palestinians are modern ancestors of the cannites and are thus indeginious so i m just wondering why is it offensive to acknowledge that palestinian identity came through the arabization of this land especially when that s what the history the sourcer and even your own comment suggest i repeat palestinians were arabized but are indeginious yeah i agree with that point the land was arabized and also what exactly do you mean when you say palestinian are you referring to a modern national identity that developed after the s or to anyone who lived here before the state of israel neither i mean modern palestinian peoples even before the arab conquest there were many others and when the romans renamed this land palestina to erase its jewish identity jews didn t start calling themselves palestinians not because they didn t belong here but because the term was created to erase their identity of course they wouldn t adopt a name that was meant to erase them and how is that relevant to palestinian ancestry so when a political movement adopted the name palestine in the twentieth century that doesn t mean it reflects an ancient nation it means it was a modern creation born out of a political moment not historical continuity yeah the land was called cannan at first then israel then palestine imagine modern palestinians wanted to choose a name which one would they choose that doesn t make it illegitimate but it also doesn t make it ancient and if the movement was shaped in part through opposition to israel s existence then isn t that worth examining not to delegitimize it but to understand how identity can sometimes be built in reaction rather than in rooted continuity none of this is meant to deny anyone s lived experience but if we want real understanding we have to be honest about where our identities begin all of them i repeat the last point prior to the land was called by three names israel palestine and cannan which name do you think palestinans would choose']"

said they weren t ready and needed more time only of the people actually supported hamas there were parties in the election hamas got fatah representing the plo got three other terrorist organizations combined got and three independent candidates combined got there was no non terrorist option because they didn t want one but israel and netanyahu specifically funded and supported hamas till they allowed foreign funding to go to them when they were the non violent alternative to fatah after israel couldn t prevent them from being funded as they were the government of gaza and israel had pulled out of gaza in but half of the population are kids who weren t old enough to vote or not even born yet before wwii the last election that the public was allowed to vote in the nsdap got half a percent less of the vote than hamas did in and a month ago palestinians supported hamas when polled you cannot defeat hamas on the contrary a group can be said to be defeated when all its members are dead if not before when this war is over not even the hamas leadership in qatar will still be breathing look at the us s response to fucking insanely stupid isis and al qaeda are still around the latter is times bigger now than at that s primarily because the us has not yet admitted what the enemy is that it is fighting muslims have known for years westerners are a little slower on the uptake', 'we recognise that gaza has not held an election in atleast years so since when hamas was elected into power after which they stopped all elections its logical to say that you cant say they represent all palestinians because palestinians have been deprived of the chance to decide on who should represent them for years many in gaza today would likely not even want hamas in power and likely if given the chance without fear of retaliation would vote against hamas if anouther election were held today when hamas s term ended and they did not hold elections that was the time for gazans to rise up and overthrow hamas and hold new elections there are two responses to this the gazan people didn t care that hamas stayed in power and or preferred that hamas stay in power in this scenario even tho there weren t elections the gazan people tacitly gave their approval of the hamas government if true then it seems the gazan people are somewhat to blame according to what you stated about israel or the gazan people did care that hamas stayed in power and didn t want it however they were not strong enough or organized enough to overthrow hamas if true then the gazans are victims of hamas as much as israelis are no matter which one you pick the result is the same hamas has to be destroyed politically and militarily in gaza it s just a matter of methods and implementation that you disagree with',

territories in the near future while say they do not support that demand for elections stands at in the gaza strip and in the west bank however a majority of believes no legislative or legislative and presidential elections will take place soon if new presidential elections were held today and only two were nominated mahmoud abbas and ismail haniyeh only would participate and from among those abbas would receive and haniyeh of the votes compared to for haniyeh and for abbas three months ago in the gaza strip abbas receives of the votes and haniyeh receives in the west bank abbas receives and

over the government despite being opposed to israel and having full civil rights and being a population majority that has always been allowed into their homes that s just me playing around with what you said so far the reality is that israel expelled muslims from their home when they settled in because muslim arabs were definitely the population majority now they have the full civil rights on paper but as proven by the current events those are just to save face israel can say they have full civil rights but also say that they have to evict from their homes at some point in time and the muslim arabs can t do anything about it i don t even know why you re talking to me the full picture is obvious from how israel tear gasses full rights civilians in the aqsa mosque and arrests their children regularly if everything was as rosy and colorful as you pretend is muslim arabs would have voted you all out of the country', 'arab israelis do not in fact have equal rights under israeli law even putting aside the discriminatory but largely symbolic basic law these are some rights that jewish israelis have that arab israelis don t the right to claim pre property under the absentee law put on the books by ben gurion in no descendent of palestinians whether israeli or not has the right to claim property they fled from in that the israeli government seized and redistributed this does not apply to jewish israelis who have used the law to resettle east jerusalem by kicking palestinians who had moved in using pre property deeds this is why thousands of arab israelis march to the site of their former villages every year as a protest against this discriminatory policy the right to family and spouse immigration arab israelis whose extended families are often split between several different countries as well as gaza and the west bank do not have the right to apply for a pathway to citizenship not even a greencard or visa for their relatives with a small exception from when the knesset was not able to renew this policy israeli palestinians who married non israeli palestinians also could not get citizenship or even identity cards for their spouses jewish israelis however do have full rights to family and spouse naturalization and immigration the right to trial under israeli law arab israelis as outlined by a recent vox video can be sent to military and not civil court for crimes of a political nature where the guaranteed rights of an israeli citizen no longer apply to them while these crimes can include violence it can also include things like social media posts this never applies to jewish israelis even when facing trial for settler violence or hate crimes some of these rights are denied in order to control any threats to the jewish majority demographics of israel this is why the current vision of zionism where an unchallengeable jewish majority is necessary depends upon the repression of certain arab israeli rights but that was not the case of the visions of hertzl sometimes he was irregular or other liberals of his generation who did not expect jewish people to ever naturally overtake the number of palestinians they believed that a jewish minoritarian nation within a democratic arab jewish state was enough to safeguard their rights and culture', 'arab israelis are not equal to jewish israelis i often hear that arab israelis are equal to jews often form an israeli official or a supporter of the government of course i rarely if ever hear this from an arab israeli themselves in this post i ll explain why i don t believe arab israelis are equal to jewish israelis the israeli declaration of independence of israel says there should be complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants regardless of religion race or sex it also supports freedom of religion conscience language education and culture while on paper equal a number of official sources acknowledge that arab citizens of israel are unequal to jewish israelis in many aspects of life the arab citizens of israel live in a reality in which they experience discrimination as arabs their inequality has been documented in a large amount of crible surveys and studies and have been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions we know sadly the jewish majority s awareness of this discrimination and inequality is quite low nonetheless it plays an important role of arab citizens this discrimination is widely accepted both by jews and arabs alike the u s state department country reports on human rights practices which one would assume to be pro israel notes that israeli arab advocacy organizations have challenged the government s policy of demolishing illegal buildings in the arab sector and claimed that the government was more restrictive in issuing building permits in arab communities than in jewish communities thereby not accommodating natural growth in june the supreme court ruled that omitting arab towns from specific government social and economic plans is discriminatory this judgment builds on previous assessments of disadvantages suffered by arab israelis israeli arab organizations have challenged as discriminatory the master plan for the northern areas of israel which listed as priority goals increasing the galilee s jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of arab towns israeli arabs were not required to perform mandatory military service and in practice only a small percentage of israeli arabs served in the military those who did not serve in the army had less access than other citizens to social and economic benefits for which military service was a prerequisite or an advantage such as housing new household subsidies and employment especially government or security related industrial employment the ivri committee on national service has issued official recommendations to the government that israel arabs not be compelled to perform national or civic service but be afforded an opportunity to perform such service according to a university of haifa study a tendency existed to impose heavier prison terms to arab citizens than to jewish citizens human rights advocates claimed that arab citizens were more likely to be convicted of murder and to have been denied bail the orr commission of inquiry s report stated that the government handling of the arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory that the government did not show sufficient sensitivity to the needs of the arab population and did not take enough action to allocate state resources in an equal manner as a result serious distress prevailed in the arab sector in various areas evidence of distress included poverty unemployment a shortage of land serious problems in the education system and substantially defective infrastructure the u s state department country reports on human rights practices notes that according to a study at hebrew university three times more money was invested in education of jewish children as in arab children according human rights watch says cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents military service discriminate against arab children the cuts will also affect the children of jewish ultra orthodox parents who do not serve in the military but they are eligible for extra subsidies including educational supplements not available to palestinian arab children in just of civil servants were arabs even though arab israelis are of the population the bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in israel and one of the highest in the developed world and that s no accident the budget of israel s health ministry allocated arab communities less than of its budget for healthcare facility development in march several israeli civil rights groups stated in a report that the current knesset was the most racist in israeli history with bills proposed in and that would discriminate against the country s arab minority a preliminary report commissioned by israel s courts administration and the israel bar association found in which is very credible found out that arab israelis are more likely than israeli jews to be convicted of crimes after being charged israeli law also discriminates between jewish and arab residents of jerusalem regarding rights to recover property owned before the madness in the arab israeli war the absentees property law said that any property within the land that israel conquered which was owned by an arab who had left the country between november and may or by a palestinian who had merely been abroad or in area of palestine held by hostile forces up to september lost all rights to that property which is shut ridiculous palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by jewish or israeli forces before and during the arab israeli war but remained within the borders of what would become israel aka internally displaced arab israelis are deemed present absentees by the legislation which the phrase present absente i et self sound like an oxymoron present absentees are regarded as absent by the israeli government because they left their homes even if they did not mean to leave them for more than a few days and even if they did so against their will following the six day war in which israel occupied the west bank from where it annexed east jerusalem israel then passed in the law and administration arrangements law allowing for jews who had lost property in east jerusalem and the west bank during the war to reclaim it palestinian residents of jerusalem absentees in the same positions and arab israelis present absentees who owned property in west jerusalem or other areas within the state of israel and lost it as a result of the war could not and still can not recover their properties israeli legislation thus allows jews to recover their land but not arabs i once saw a post that said sex was the only hope to solve the conflict well you are about to be disappointed in the case of mixed arab jewish marriages it s quite controversial more than half of israeli jews believed intermarriage was equivalent to national treason according to a opinion survey a group of jewish men in the jerusalem neighborhood of pisgat ze ev started patrolling the neighborhood to stop jewish women from dating arab men the municipality of petah tikva has also announced it would provide a telephone hotline for friends and family to report jewish girls who date arab men as well as psychologists to provide counseling the city of kiryat gat launched a campaign in its schools to warn jewish girls to not date the local bedouin men sentiments work both ways a survey found that of israeli muslims and of israeli christians would be uncomfortable with a child of theirs marrying a jew of israeli jews would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a muslim and would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a christian the mossawa center an advocacy organization for arabs israelis blames the knesset of discrimination against them they cited a increase in discriminatory and racist bills submitted to the knesset in the year according to the report bills deemed by the center to be discriminatory and racist were placed on the legislation table in such bills were initiated in in bills deemed discriminatory by the mossawa center were discussed in the knesset the reports calls out racist proposals such as a bill to revoke government funding from organizations acting against the principles of the state the coalition against racism and the mossawa center said that the proposed legislation seeks to de legitimize israel s arab citizens by decreasing their civil rights inequality in the allocation of public funding for jewish and arab needs happens regularly there is massive employment discrimination as well in february the new york times reported that percent of the impoverished families in israel were arabs in human rights watch described government run arab schools as a world apart from government run jewish schools the report found major differences in basically every aspect of the education system in the follow up committee for arab education said that the israeli government spent an average of a year on arab students compared to for jewish students the drop out rate for arabs was twice as high as for jews versus there was a classroom shortage in the arab sector according to the u s state department country reports on human rights practices for israel and the occupied territories israeli arabs were underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most universities and in higher professional and business ranks well educated arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education according to sikkuy arab citizens held approximately to of the country s university faculty positions arab educators have long voiced concerns over institutionalized budgetary discrimination an august study published by the hebrew university s school of education claimed that israel s education ministry discriminated against arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the average per student allocation at arab junior high schools was one fifth the average at jewish ones this was due to the allocation method funds were first divided between arab and jewish school systems according to the number of students in each and then allocated to needy students however due to the large proportion of such students in the arab sector they receive less funds per student than jewish students the ministry of education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index ministry data on the percentage of high school students who passed their matriculation exams showed that arab towns were ranked lowest except for fureidis which had the third highest pass rate in israel racist polls a poll by the arab advocacy group the center against racism showed negative attitudes towards arabs the poll found that of jews believe arabs are a security threat would refuse to live in the same building as an arab believe that arab culture is inferior to israeli culture support for segregation between jewish and arab citizens was higher among jews of middle eastern origin mizrahis another poll by sammy smooha found that of jewish israelis avoided entering arab towns and cities feared the possibility of widespread civil unrest among arab israelis a poll by the center against racism found that of israeli jews would not live in a building with arabs over would not invite arabs to their homes believed that arabs should be stripped of the right to vote over agreed that the state should encourage emigration of arab citizens to other countries considered arab culture primitive asked what do you feel when you hear people speaking arabic said hate and said fear only reported positive or neutral feelings a poll of israeli high school students found that did not think arab israelis were entitled to the same rights as jews in israel and thought arabs should not be elected to the knesset surprisingly for me these figures rose among religious students a pew research poll released in march showed that close to half of all israeli jews are in favor of transferring or expelling arab israelis of israeli jews strongly agree or agree with the idea and strongly disagree or disagree the in person polling was conducted in a relatively calm period from late through early calm in this conflict s standards arab polls in a patriotism survey of arab israelis were not proud of their citizenship and were not ready to fight to defend the state another poll by sammy smooha found that of arab israelis justified hezbollah s capture of idf reservists ehud goldwasser and eldad regev in a cross border raid thought israel was justified in going to war following the kidnapping justified hezbollah rocket attacks on northern israel during the lebanon war of israeli arabs saw the idf bombing of lebanon as a war crime while of israeli arabs viewed hezbollah s bombing of israel as a war crime and said they were concerned about a possible mass expulsion of israeli arabs described zionism as racist and personally most disappointing for me of israeli arab citizens denied the holocaust ever happened surveys in found a radicalization in the positions of arab israelis towards the state of israel with of israeli arabs recognizing israel s right to exist as a jewish and democratic state down from in and believing israel has a right to exist as an independent country down from in polls also showed that of arab citizens engaged in holocaust denial a arab jewish relations survey compiled by prof sami smoocha in collaboration with the jewish arab center at the university of haifa shows that arab israelis said they blamed jews for the hardships suffered by palestinians during and after the nakba in denied the holocaust the percentage supporting the use of violence to advance arab causes climbed from in to in say they reject israel as a jewish and zionist state while opposed its existence under any terms saw the jews as foreign settlers who do not fit into the region and will eventually leave when the land will return to the palestinians a survey by mada al carmel the arab center for applied social research asked the arab students what obstacles they felt they faced in getting into university said the psychometric exam was the primary obstacle while cited jewish racism of those surveyed felt no pride in israeli achievements in whatever field and reporting negative feelings about them why i made this post there has often been a bit of an illusion of citizenship that many hold the illusion that arab israelis are equal to jewish israelis of course this is an illusion not held that arab israelis don t have and now thanks to the madness recently this illusion has broken for the world and is breaking for many israelis and that s one good thing that came out of the violence many israeli jews are now aware of how their fellow citizens actually feel it looks as is if the arab population is being used as a fig leaf by the israeli government to give off a look we ain t racist look of course if you ask an arab israeli it is no question that the government is racist and they are not equal that being said thanks to a decent economic situation and liberal rules in israel not including the west bank and gaza they are still better off than any other arabs in the levant sadly the same can t be said about those in the occupied territories i think the recent madness will make israeli jews more sceptical or hatful of the arab israelis rather than sympathetic and arab israelis will just get more anti israel especially in the age of social media in conclusion arab israelis are not equal to jewish israelis because they are given a lesser education lesser infrastructure and funding are discriminated against both systematically and by the public as they are a minority and the polls back this up lastly i called them arab israelis even though this is a bit of an outdated term just cuz saying anything else would have been longer']"

believe such studies sounds like someone floundering because they refuse to listen to reality i m not claiming that of the residents of gaza have a distinctly canaanite dna i am claiming that of palestinians have at least canaan dna and it s hardly preposterous it s literally science we know more than enough about canaan dna and markers because scientists have found ancient dna from bronze age canaanites in archaeological remains at sites such as sidon they have used genome wide analysis and statistical modelling on this ancient dna and compared it to modern populations finding that palestinians derive more than of their ancestry from that same ancient canaan population that isn t guess work it s fact whether you like it or not and this genetic continuity proves exactly what we re debating that the palestinians ancestry predates arabization proving their indiginiety so do enlighten me where exactly is the propaganda', 'that makes no sense ok maybe a little bit both arabs and jews possess canaanite dna but we know from history that the jewish kingdoms replaced the canaanites in the region the canaanite dna persisted simply because the canaanites predated the jews in the area were not eradicated and their dna persisted but no one disputes that the jewish kingdom replaced the ancient canaanite civilization palestinians also have arab dna from the arabian peninsula when the arabs came they mingled with a population that already had canaanite dna hence the dna persisted until the s the palestinians saw themselves as arabs in coalition with the other arabs in the region they never saw themselves as descendants of the canaanites the arabs in palestine saw themselves as part of a larger arab state it was never even meant to be an independent palestinian state they had names such as south syria proposed jordan proposed to absorb the whole thing all that dna and ancient history is important but impossible to unravel in you had two groups of people living in the land who saw themselves as indigenous both had peoples in the land for centuries who never left despite changing colonial powers both imported people in the s i don t see how any of this leads to jews having less of a right to palestine the two parties were constantly fighting with the minority jews seeing times as many casualties per capita as the arabs a partition plan was made the arabs got of the british mandate when you count in jordan they got of the levant which includes parts of egypt and other surrounding arab countries for some reason jewish self determination in a tiny part of that land was something they could not countenance and decided to go to war', 'palestinian people are literally canaanites lol indigenous to palestine their dna is literally predominantly levantine with not much penisular arab ancestry palestinians test closest to the canaanite skeletons from megiddo ashkelon sidon and south palestine seems like you haven t done your homework also many palestinian christians converted to islam and many many samaritans converted to islam too this is well documented and easy to fact check palestinians are descendants of canaanites and natufians canaanites have been living on that land for almost years natufians are the first civilisation of that soil dating back years multiple genetic research studies on excavated canaanite skeletons and dna comparisons with modern populations have found that palestinians derive around of their dna from levantine canaanites rest is admixture with peninsular arabs mesopotamians africans and europeans google the below terms and see for yourself palestinians bronze age levantines where did the palestinian dna come from palestinian dna bronze age levantines palestinian genetics palestinian dna where does the palestinian dna come from palestinians canaanites furthermore greeks referred to palestine as palestine before the time of jesus so way before romans the name was then officially changed to palestine just over years ago first recorded name of that land was canaan years ago present day palestine was split into phoenicia philistia judea galilee edom and arubu tribes lived in the far south in the negov most of these groups were never jewish area of today s palestine was around jewish years ago rest were polytheistic canaanites throughout the land and arubu tribes in the south syrian golan that is also being occupied by zionists was also never jewish around of isr el are ashtenazi jews ashtenazi dna is european caucus and turkic and only around or less is middle eastern there have been jewish communities in egypt syria and greece before the time of jesus people willingly converted and moved who is to say they aren t converts from there also many romans converted to judaism before this was outlawed central and south italians have around levantine dna due to various historical events dating years ago who is to say ashtenaxis aren t european converts in large numbers their culture is european they are european yemeni jews are genetically purely peninsular arab they are the same as muslim yemeni there was even a jewish kingdom in yemen hundreds of years ago ruled by a convert to judaism they are converts so are ethiopian jews and indian jews etc only jewish groups that actually have a genome similar to palestinians lebanese druze jordanians and samaritans are iraqi

canaanites impact from before bce years before present historical records and later genetic studies indicate that the palestinian people descend mostly from from ancient levantines extending back to bronze age inhabitants of levant a study by ver nica fernandes and others concluded that palestinians have a primarily indigenous origin a study haber almarri et al found that palestinians cluster close and are similar to lebanese druze jordanians and syrians a study looking at the whole genomes of world populations found that the palestinian samples clustered in the middle eastern genomic group which included samples such as samaritan bedouin jordanian and lebanese are indigenous people of that soil this study is great too study by haber almarri xue et al from and see who the actual

the cycle is pushing towards escalation and any specific escalation can be justified by its preceding event i am a therapist who has dedicated his career to working with trauma and i have seen these cycles of escalations writ small but still devastating in the lives of many individuals and families people who are hurt people who hurt others because they are hurting people who hurt others because they are afraid of being hurt themselves i hear the echos of pain and hurt throughout generations like ghosts that feed off of pain to grow stronger the first thing you learn in doing trauma work is that separating out victims and perpetrators is often a messy proposition and one that shifts depending on what time or what relationship you are focusing on in any given session people are often both sometimes even simultaneously if you go into trauma work looking to find heroes and villains you will find more than you ever thought possible and none at all the second thing you learn is that you cannot wait for the pain to lessen before the healing can begin the pain lessens because the healing begins the third thing you learn is that healing is not a passive experience it is often a courageous and defiant act against what the body and mind has learned is fundamentally necessary to keep themselves safe trauma tells truths about the dangers of the world but lies about the roads that travel from and through them it divides people relationships and experiences into rigid binaries of strength and weakness safety and vulnerability winners and losers fighters and victims trauma tells you that the only way to make it through the fire is to run faster fight harder and smash obstacles or set controlled burns ahead of you so the fire is always in your sight and never coming up from behind to heal means forgoing all that not listening to that damaged part of your psyche no matter how convinced it is that the fire is going to engulf you the moment you deviate from what it knows is the only way to keep you safe and fourth and perhaps most challenging at least for me lesson learned in trauma work is that true justice can be a lighthouse to steer one s ship but it isn t a destination many will ever reach that apology you hoped for may never be coming or may never fill the hole you hoped it would seeing your perpetrator suffer rarely makes your suffering feel any lighter hollywood endings are make believe but grace and forgiveness are real and accessible and their power towards healing often takes people by surprise so i will not answer your question as a diplomat or politician but i am not someone who hasn t sat at a table and helped negotiate functional treaties with trauma before it can be done in this case it would mean israel taking the bold and courageous step of choosing diplomacy and restraint over brute military force not because brute military force could not be justified but because it will ultimately further the cycle of trauma and escalation that is in no one s interest including israel s own israel could have seized the moment of initial international sympathy and shock to draw in closer to its western allies and the strained but with some recent progress towards normalizing relationships with the arab world itself and amplify international condemnation of hamas and unite pressure on and isolation of hamas amongst those who otherwise might have been less willing or engaged israel could have strengthened its relationship with fatah plo in the west bank through restarting meaningful negotiations there in return for real security guarantees and thereby showed the benefits of the alternative to the approach hamas took in gaza and israel could have negotiated prisoner exchanges for the hostages while also giving a clear deadline for further steps including militarily if the negotiations did not progress the negotiations would need time and undoubtedly gruelling patience and involvement from arab partners if they were to be fruitful but there may have been space for them to be successful under the right circumstances particularly if israel was able to use its restraint and its reopening of negotiations with fatah to build on its progress with normalizing its relationships in the arab world is this fair is this justice those are the wrong questions sadly if you are truly committed to healing and

the un in november of accepted by the jews and rejected by the arabs in this phase the british mandate is still in effect there is no israeli army formally there is the paramilitary organization of hagana which at the time is mostly focused on defending jewish towns and neighborhoods from arab attacks during this time at least to arabs leave and they do so on their own accord the reasons for their leaving range from not wanting to be part of the new jewish state if they stay according the un partition map and some out of fear from the impending full scale war that neighboring arab states were threatening if the jewish state were to be created these people were not expelled by israel in any shape or form the second phase from mid may through to the armistice signed in in this phase some arabs were expelled by israel some escaped because of the fear of war and some were advised to leave by arab countries and return with the victorious arab armies so during this period another to exit it is virtually impossible to tell what percent of these people left solely because they were expelled by the israeli army all evidence is that there was no formal policy of expulsion so even if were expelled by israel that would mean to people the claim one can make is that after the war ended they were not allowed back in but in all fairness their condition to coming back was the dismantling for the jewish state and also the jews that were expelled from arab countries were not let back in either the arab exodus began voluntarily as early as december when established arab families in haifa and jaffa realized that according to the un partition plan the cities they lived in were slated to fall under jewish control similarly wealthy arab residents from the western neighborhoods of jerusalem began to leave in historian benny morris s words the arab flight became a sort of contagious disease spreading from house to house neighbor to neighbor street to street neighborhood to neighborhood and later from village to village the upper and educated classes feared being killed or wounded and feared the anarchy that accompanied the gradual withdrawal of the british civil and military administration most of the high class families who left haifa jerusalem jaffa acre and tiberias believed their exile would be temporary this phenomenon was described in the contemporary palestinian press as follows the first group of the fifth column traitors are those abandoning their homes and businesses and going to live elsewhere many of them lived in great comfort and luxury as soon as the first sign of trouble appeared they took off to avoid bearing the burden of the struggle directly or indirectly the neighboring countries did us a great disservice by accepting these who fled the battlefield they are the worst type of our fifth column traitors and deserve the harshest punishment from the palestinian newspaper al sha ab june according to morris following their departure the peasants and urban poor were also forced to leave having witnessed the mass flight of the wealthy which led to the closure of businesses schools law offices clinics and public services adding to this was the withdrawal of the british the departing people left due to fear of being left to face the zionist enemy alone despite the poverty and difficulty associated with leaving morris describes the first months of for the arabs of palestine as follows feelings of general collapse and disintegration in many places a small spark was enough to make the residents pack up and flee residents of arab cities fled and in doing so dragged along with them the rural population of the surrounding areas the causes for the departure of roughly a quarter million arabs in the first half of were largely internal arab causes lack of leadership economic hardship breakdown of law and order the voluntary departure in the early months of the war due to the absence of leadership and collapse of order can be seen in this report from a palestinian newspaper the residents of the large village of sheikh munis and many other arab villages in the tel aviv area have disgraced us all by abandoning their villages with their belongings and their children one cannot avoid comparing this shameful flight with the steadfast stance of the haganah in settlements located in arab regions but what use are comparisons for we all know that the haganah rushes into battle with courage while we flee from war from the palestinian newspaper al siraj march the voluntary departure in spring due to calls from arab leaders and institutions is reflected in this report from the economist correspondent in palestine in the days that followed the israeli authorities who now had full control of haifa called upon all arabs to remain and assured them that no harm would come to them to the best of my knowledge all british residents who were asked by their arab friends advised them to stay various factors influenced their decision to flee there is little doubt that the strongest factor was the broadcasts from the arab higher committee which called on all arabs to leave haifa it was made clear to them that once british forces completed their evacuation the armies of all the arab states would invade palestine and drive the jews into the sea it was also implied that any arabs who remained in haifa and accepted jewish protection would be considered traitors at that time the arabs of palestine still had some trust in the arab league s ability to deliver on its promises from the economist london october about two years later the editor of the lebanese newspaper al huda habib issa summarized the matter in hindsight in an editorial immediately after the british publicly announced their departure from the mandate in palestine the arab league began convening meetings and conferences its secretary general abdul rahman azzam pasha issued many declarations promising the arab nations that conquering palestine and tel aviv effectively the jewish capital would be as simple as a military parade azzam s statements noted that the armies were already at the borders and that the millions of pounds spent by the jews on land acquisition and economic development would surely fall into arab hands since it would be a simple matter to throw the jews into the mediterranean the arabs of palestine had no choice but to listen to the advice of the league and believe what azzam pasha and others told them that leaving their lands was only temporary and would end within days with the successful completion of the arab campaign of punishment against israel from the daily lebanese newspaper al huda june expulsion orders formal organized expulsion orders were issued to palestinian arabs during the war on two main occasions during the implementation of plan dalet when the haganah shifted from defense to offense and expelled arabs from key transport routes and border areas after the conquest of ramla and lydda there is no dispute that some of the refugees were expelled but the actual number is likely less than of those who actually left the new historians with the opening of israeli and british archives years after the war a new wave of research emerged led by the so called new historians these scholars argued that everything previously published about the war was largely zionist propaganda by official historians however even they had to acknowledge many arabs left without being expelled their criticism of israel was that israeli policy was to prevent their return even when they wanted to return their return was banned villages destroyed fields ruined or handed over to jewish settlements etc both the british national library and national library of israel have

minister of the interior fathi hammad declared on a december show on al aqsa tv hamas gaza that the palestinians are preparing to establish an islamic caliphate with jerusalem as its capital he said the palestinian people have been soldiers throughout history they are now preparing to liberate jerusalem and the al aqsa mosque and i am saying this loud and clear the palestinian people are preparing to establish the caliphate with jerusalem as its capital city inshallah jerusalem will not only be the capital city of palestine as an independent state it will be the capital city of the islamic caliphate hamas leaders our goal is establishment of global islamic caliphate not just liberation of palestine the middle east media research institute december palestinians special dispatch no', 'yes because we should believe everything israel says because israel are already so kind and peaceful to those on the west bank who do not have hamas right it s easier for us to just think hamas bad and israel good but it just isn t the reality i read the israeli newspaper haaretz and i found an article commenting on his speech as i wasn t aware of it before found some interesting points made by the author we dismantled the military bases in gaza but not in the west bank just as israel believes it is entitled to bomb in response to a shelling so does hamas see itself as entitled and even obligated to respond to the harm caused by israel to the west bank s palestinians and what will happen if they lay down their weapons the pretense that hamas is an equal military opponent to israel serves its political purposes and image but it does not free palestine in contrast it helps israeli propaganda the palestinians are not israel s neighbors they are the indigenous people who emerged lived in and developed the land long before zionist immigration leaving aside the historical circumstances that led to its founding israel was established at their expense through the expulsion of over half of them and the creation of a political system that from the beginning intended to exclude them almost million palestinians live under the year old israeli military and shin bet rule whether directly like in annexed east jerusalem and area c hybrid direct and indirect such as in the palestinian authority enclaves or effectively as in the gaza strip the government of israel determines nearly every significant parameter of their lives it controls the borders it controls the water resources and land that it appropriates according to its own desires the freedom of movement and thus the economy too family and social connections all this while the palestinians are deprived of any civil rights and are barred from participating in the process of electing the government that determines their lives two states for two peoples parroting the hollow slogan is the required lip service in international forums but we can t accuse lapid and his advisers of providing this service here the blame lies with european and arab nations which have enabled israel for the last years to carve up the territory designated for a palestinian state and turn it into small disjointed enclaves surrounded by constantly expanding settlement blocs like his predecessors when lapid blathers about the two state solution he really means the seven state solution greater israel and the six or maybe even more palestinian bantustans as i say it s difficult to look at things objectively and it s easier just to ask why hamas didn t just take the deal it s not that simple even this article will have some bias but they are israeli authors and i think their cynicism is justified more than others']"

'cleansing is']","['it s important to separate ethnic cleansing from the enforcement of law that results in forced removal and international law does this if individuals as individuals are being removed that s legal if whole population centers are being removed it is not so for example in a legal process people would be entitled to a trial with due process in an ethnic cleansing they just get shot or whatever what is being advocated for is in the other post and even in your comment is the latter ethnic cleansing specifically targets people because of their ethnicity or religion whereas enforcement actions target individuals based on legal status not identity completely false that sort of standard would allow any state to ethnically cleanse they just create a law which an entire population violates i want to clear x territory from group y i say make it illegal to live within miles of z river and enforce the law the key distinction is intent where the state acts against a legal violation not a group s inherent characteristics and the intent of the un is to maintain the racial purity of palestine large number of un members view jews as a racial pollution and thus believe palestine is legitimate in rejecting jewish emmigration no one objected to many instances of immigration that are similar for example russians in eastern europe certainly not decades later and applying to descendants the norm is precisely the opposite of what s going on with israel the deportation of illegal immigrants is generally not considered ethnic cleansing they are when they are done in mass and the communities they live in are destroyed upholding international law is crucial because it restores justice and establishes precedents that prevent future violations really gaza hamas are blatent violators of the international law around distinction can israel just absolve itself of all the actions since they upholding international law and restoring justice somehow when iran was violating the npt war wasn t justified you really want to open the door to the horrors you are advocating for upholding international law is crucial because it restores justice and establishes precedents that prevent future violations i m not ignoring it i think the removals have discriminatory intent and the whole settlement argument is a cover i also don t think non discriminatory intent grants one license to commit crimes against humanity which is where we disagree i advocate for the expulsion of the people living in illegal settlements purely due to such settlements being in violation of international law and do not support the killing or genocide of such people expulsion is killing you bomb rape burn down homes murder until they leave that s how it is done and before you go to the idf no the idf can t do the settlers rd of the officer core are settlers something like and likely an even higher percentage of idf deeply disagree with the un s position if the knesset ordered it which they won t do there would be a coup not a removal of the settlers they get removed they get removed by a foreign army which has to do it against idf opposition you are talking about the death of millions here in practice but in theory let s say just the death of say k to terrorize the other k into leaving', 'on the topic of gradual genocide gaza s population has only gone up over the last years this fact alone challenges the idea that they have been experiencing a genocide over this timeframe to call this a genocide would go against the definition itself and would open the doors to the loss of meaning of the word genocide itself which would make future designation of the term in other conflicts more difficult this would have negative consequences on the implementation of international law and would reduce the validity of the term itself with regards to ethnic cleansing i can see that this is something the far right israeli government is pushing for however ethnic cleansing is not genocide i am absolutely against ethnic cleansing of course and i oppose this policy completely what muddies the water on this topic though is the definition of ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic racial or religious groups from a given area with the intent of making the society ethnically homogeneous unlike the definition of genocide the term ethnic cleansing does not include national groups the palestinian identity at its core is a national identity not ethnic consider the fact that ethnically palestinians are the same as jordanians and israeli arabs after all they were part of the same country prior to i e the british mandate of palestine it is only in recent years that they have been considered a distinct group based on a shared nationalist cause please note that i am not trying to justify the removal of palestinians from gaza here i am only trying to use accurate terms which is what the whole aim of my post is in essence i would not say that genocide needs a new name but in this case i think the usage of the term ethnic cleansing needs a new name instead i am saying this from a scholarly perspective and i am not trying to make a moral or political commentary on the situation in gaza but rather i am calling into question the very language we use to accurately describe what is going on morally my stance on the situation in gaza is that people who want to leave should be able to and those who wish to stay should also be able to israel should not force either outcome on people in gaza and the gazan s should have the agency to decide on their fate israel should introduce more provisions to prevent forced expulsion such as resuming the flow of aid and the pursuit of a political resolution to the conflict such as the implementation of a new governing body in gaza with the help of the international community and local leaders who oppose hamas this is not something that can be achieved until hamas has been dismantled however', 'accusing israel of ethnic cleansing is quite ironic it s a spurious accusation and an absurd one no matter how common it is on the internet ironically israel is the only country in the region that did not systematically expel ethnic and religious minorities from its territory whether during war or in peacetime just in the levant in the th century alone the jews were originally ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in both gaza and hebron in almost years before israel declared independence and almost years before the first settlement in the wb not to mention the ethnic cleaning of virtually all jews from syria lebanon and the kingdom of jordan in the middle of the th century according to red cross and unrwa records over jews were ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in the wb including east jerusalem in when the arab legion invaded and jordan illegally occupied the territory for almost years even the jewish quarter of the old city of jerusalem was cleared of all jews and demolished in when it was captured by the arab legion and renamed arab east jerusalem that divided jerusalem until jordan forfeited its west bank in after losing another gratuitous war of conquest against israel on the other hand israel did not systematically expel arabs from its territory in fact the israeli declaration of independence specifically invites arabs within its sovereign borders to remain as israeli citizens and help to build the new country together many arabs did which is why over of israeli citizens are non jewish arabs with equal citizenship rights there were plenty of members of many arab ethnic groups and minority religions like the druze and beduins who fought alongside israel against the invading arab legion in and were proud to do so compare the multiculturalism and secularism of israel with the territories under the control of hamas and the pa that remain completely judenrein since at least it s quite a contrast the fact is that despite being the jewish state israel is the only secular country in the region where religious and ethnic minorities have equal citizenship rights and freedoms and where women and gays also have equal rights you will never see a gay pride parade in either gaza or ramallah for example almost of israeli citizens are muslim arabs and even more are christians druze beduins zoroastrians and bah s religions and ethnicities that face discrimination and oppression in the surrounding ethno centric arab and islamic countries but have found refuge in israel the bah faith s international headquarters for example known as the bah world centre is located in the northern city of haifa in israel unlike the situation in the territories under palestinian rule all israeli citizens both men and women have equal rights and freedoms regardless of religion ethnicity sexual orientation or national origin a situation not found in any of the other countries in the region arab muslims serve in the israeli parliament for example muslims serve as commanders in the idf there is even an arab muslim justice on israel s supreme court and he s not the first religious and ethnic minorities just do not have the same rights and freedoms in any of the other countries in the region like they have in israel the irony is that jews do not serve in the palestinian government or in the governments of any of the other countries of the muslim world precisely because they were gratuitously and systematically ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in those countries in the middle of the last century almost a million jews were gratuitously expelled from their ancient communities in all the countries of the muslim world from morocco east through egypt and yemen north through syria and lebanon all the way through iraq and iran a century ago for example the population of baghdad was a third jewish they were jews living in their own ancient communities in iraq that predated the invention of islam and the arrival of the arabs by a thousand years ironically most israeli jews today are not ashkenazi jews from europe as many people on the internet seem to believe but are in fact the descendants of those refugees expelled from the arab and muslim world they re sephardic and mizrahi jews and babylonian jews expelled from iraq and persian jews from iran']"

on the lawn together during the protest i know many jewish students do not feel safe because of their views not because they are jewish imo and that s not ok there is no room for antisemitism on campus period that doesn t mean it s acceptable to bring in the police to arrest and suspend students who are peacefully protesting on campus', 'this inflammatory post centered around a persecution fetish is giving off vibes like this lol columbia university has descended into chaos not really students have peacefully demonstrated outside by doing sit ins and encampments the only thing resembling chaos here were columbia students getting suspended expelled and subsequently getting arrested for trespassing on their campus after the president of the university called the cops on them this seems to be the case as ilhan omar s daughter who attended columbia was also arrested on those charges for protesting on campus after being suspended it s a dirty trick and one you left out of your post in order to paint the protestors as criminals given that columbia university is a private university and anti israel protests frequently turn violent not really i m sure you can cherry pick a few instances of violence at these protests while removing the context behind them like the alleged instances of violence mentioned in the article but this encampment seems to be a broadly peaceful movement uh huh telling jews to go back to poland is not free inquiry rioting vandalism trespassing and limiting the movement of others are not considered free speech instead of giving some nuance to the protestors you lump them all in as violators of the law who are not innocently expressing their right to free speech but are in your imagination targeting jews specifically and harassing them based on their ethnic background go back to poland a mob surrounding jews and calling them genocidal freaks it is right to rebel hamas give them hell settlers settlers go back home palestine is ours alone al qasam s next targets now look through those links and try thinking about whether or not maybe there is more to the story than the evil protestors harassing innocent jews because of their ethnic background when jewish students are holding seder at the encampment funny is that if you at least showed an ounce of this sorrow for people being murdered or when the jewish voice for peace and students for justice in palestine were banned by columbia or when columbia students were sprayed by former idf soldiers with a chemical substance i would be taking your concerns about slogans praising al qassam more seriously though it doesn t even look like that was at columbia but definitely in nyc frankly i am skeptical of the claims and videos used to demonize the protestors not just because they ignore the overwhelming majority of protestors but things like the woman talking about al qassam s next targets could quite easily be a character in a pro israeli demonstration trying to get their point across see it should go without saying that this jews apparently do not count as a minority who are targets of hateful ideology it s ok to break the law against objectionable speakers the protestors in both cases are believed to be fighting back against bigotry the only times that columbia professors and students as well as academia in general care about free speech is when it s used to bash israel and conservatives there is a distinction between inviting a speaker to campus who will follow the law and harassment if the speaker s views are objectionable most of all columbia university does not understand what free speech is is a faulty conclusion']"

fund palestinian charities as well so there s a conflict of interest in the local reporting as well as academic aid org law org news coverage of the region with these conflicts there s no reason for academics aid law orgs regional news etc not ignore unrwa s transgressions another corrupting factor is that unrwa has a vast amount of staff compared to other united nations refugee charters i forget the exact numbers now but i believe it makes up most of the united nations employment base as the palestinian population continues to explode so does the number of unrwa staff grow and therefore the size of the un s budget itself so an unresolved growing palestinian problem directly feeds the un s growth so unrwa employees executives more or less run the un now as the elephant in the organization rather than the un having good oversight good management of unrwa importantly palestinians do get personal benefits from all this cashflow they have free schooling health care housing food etc it s not as if they are totally deprived of benefit under this system the corrupt cashflow exists above beyond what they can demand on a humanitarian basis even low status palestinian families have better education health care etc than the average low status arab in arab countries so palestinians do benefit in this system there s like an entire united nations international aid law edifice that feeds

individual palestinians are getting free food shelter health care education infrastructure aid and don t want to end unrwa why would anyone in the system of graft that feeds off unresolved palestinian refugee problems want to cut that off ultimately the important question is what helps palestinians my feeling is that in prolonging their refugee status indefinitely disrupting their economic self

israel was unaware of these alleged links then there s no way unrwa could know we shouldn t lose sight of why we have and need unrwa and israels actions play a big part in why we need unrwa but the

been transferred through israel to the unrwa the unrwa spokesman denied the claim a week later hamas confirmed it confiscated the ambulances due to bureaucratic reasons a unrwa spokesman also

know what that means what does it mean do they want states i have no idea it s hard to be afraid of a message i can t even understand whatever they re trying to communicate it s lost on me i did not hear anything about israel specifically but i did hear something adjacent like zionism is genocide the clip was so short and it happened so fast i had no idea what was going on again people are allowed to say stuff about zionism pro and con there s nothing i heard on that video clip that you can t read on this subreddit it s called free speech israel is not immune to criticism the history of israel up to an including its land invasion of gaza currently has included widespread killing of civilians murders burning villages theft of land violation of international laws torture mass starvation of a civilian population and rape and what some observers are now describing as genocide these are legitimate accusations and discussion points if israel has engaged in these activities and

the chicago bulls or root beer or gays or donald trump or joe biden it may not be right but it s a free country there is a legal line which you cannot cross and that is death threats against specific people actual property destruction bomb threats and physical assaults on other people i see none of that here and if someone does cross the line you call the cops pretty simple i tend to agree with tony kushner that right wingers are over blowing this issue because they want to silence critics of israel it s a protest if you don t agree educate the public on your point of view if you don t agree

kind of a weird thing to say something big wouldn t have a lot of social attention idk how you think the world works but usually news will cover big things that get a lot of attention from the public and just like all the big anti israeli protests get attention so would other big protests big protests a lot of people who care about the topic and make a lot of noise more awareness by and for everyone literally tens of thousands present company included protested against iran outside of iran so your way of showing other countries get a lot of attention is a protest from years ago where only k participated and just a reminder there are k people from iranian decent living in canada as canada is the rd country with the most iranians in it after iran the us so it wouldn t be unlikely that most of the people in this protest were iranians k k so even if participated it would still be the majority of the people there let s take things into perspective shall we in nov only a month after the th of october happened already people people participated in anti israel protest despite the fact the war only started and if that would happened to any other country the people would have protested in favor of it not against it then you ve got the red line protests in the netherlands in the first one that happened on may people joined the next one in june got then we got the in australia from this month smaller ones that still included tens of thousands against israel happened in germany france after days to the war those examples of course are only from europe as the biggest protests obviously happened in the muslim world with the biggest one happening in bangladesh contained between k to m people so i m sorry but one single protest that happened years ago contained mostly iranians involved tens of thousands there s no real comparison here your argument is so poor it doesn t even deserve a further response like i mentioned earlier insults wouldn t get you anywhere it makes people s arguments look weaker not stronger', 'i m not moving the goalposts my original comment was about why people care about the war in gaza and about all pro palestinians as characterised by the op my point above about college protests was about college protests which issues people care about and what actions they take in response are two different questions people can care deeply about issues but not physically protest over them people typically protest over issues that are in the hands of domestic politicians or other elected representatives they do so to convince their representatives that a large constituency cares about this issue and would like to see action nobody is protesting the uighur genocide or sudan on us college campuses or in washington or london because nobody there can do anything about it hence the point about money and support if there are people with influence over money and support they are possible targets to influence through protest if there aren t protest is pointless and potentially even harmful but the reaction among the public hoewever horrified by russias actions never devolved into what the anti israel protests devolved into even though the russia ukraine war is much clearer where it concerns morality than the israel palestine war again why would you expect protests when nobody in western countries has any influence over russia russia is already sanctioned to the maximal extent possible western politicians are literally sending billions of dollars of arms to ukraine short of sending the us military to fight russia directly what would be the point of protests look at recent major protests blm climate change occupy abortion rights israel gaza it s always about things that the people being protested can change putin doesn t care about placards in washington dc yet and j repeat myself it is the conflict that the only jewish state in the world involves that apparently elicits such a strong violent ideological and emotional response among the public even to the point of denial of israels right to exist being uncontroversial in broadening circles this is a different point us military and financial aid to israel is a legitimate target for protest within the us collegiate investments in certain industries or countries are a legitimate target for collegiate organisation you might remember the fossil fuel protests and occupy movement which were far more violent than any pro palestinian protests you seem to be saying that it is wrong for the us electorate to express its views about sending money and weapons to israel because israel is a jewish state i don t think you can seriously believe that']"

the un s borders in its partition plan because of the fact that of palestinians would fall under the jewish portion of partition while of jewish people in the region would have been in the palestinian portion of partition i see no world in which that is an equitable division of the land look at the insane map they drew to accomplish this kind of outcome you will never convince me that this was done in good faith it is gerrymandering at its finest do you really think those are borders that will foster long term peace edit even the negev is strategically important it narrows the path to a tiny choke point by which egypt can supply material aid to the west bank without violating jewish sovereignty all the coastal regions that would allow for goods to flow to the west bank would also fall under these circumstances i m not calling for the destruction of anything i m calling the partition plan inherently biased against palestinians for the benefit of the proposed jewish state i think this is a fundamental flaw in arguments that jewish leadership accepted the plan but palestinian leadership refused it so they are entirely to blame for present circumstances the outcomes of partition were drastically different between the two parties this isn t casting blame on the jewish community for accepting partition i would absolutely take the deal in their position i m saying the un s offer was inequitable on a practical level and an apples to apples comparison of the decision to accept partion is not valid i kind of repeated myself there but i think this is a truly important part of the history and current events of the region that is glossed over', 'the partition s fairness as towards percentage of land to preface this my question isn t a gotcha but rather an attempt to actually understand a position because i see this come up again and again i often see pro palestinian voices argue that the un partition plan was unfair because the proposed state of israel was allocated about of the land while the proposed state of palestine was allocated that while israel was to be jewish arab and bedouin it was an injustice to give israel more land than the majority arab state of palestine but when you look at the details most of the extra land given to israel was the negev desert which in was almost entirely arid and non arable from what i ve read according to un analyses from the time only around ish of cultivable land was in the jewish portion while the arab state would have controlled over of the arable farmland put another way the jewish state got more square mileage but much of it was desert the arab state got less land overall but most of the fertile farmland that raises my question why is the vs talking point repeated so often while the far more important issue of arable vs non arable land is left out also i m really not looking for a discussion on whether the partition should have happened what atrocities from either side lead up to it what happened after the partition failed also yes jews owned about of the arable land arabs owned and the rest was state land i get that but i really hope that if personal ownership comes up it is in the context of the question at hand and not a tangent not that it isn t interesting but that i m hoping that this post can keep the scope of the discussion narrowed to this point', 'im sorry for your loss in all the discussions i have had about this you are literally the second person that has said so i truly do appreciate it the united nations partition plan for palestine was always unfair arabs outnumbered the jews yet they always got the smallest of lands so why accept it that s why i mentioned the peel commission in arabs favor jews accepted arabs rejected and initiated an anti jewish riot the british then made the woodhead commission making three maps progressively chipping off the potential future jewish state until by it was just down to chaim weizmann said we would be fools not to accept even if the jewish state were the size of a tablecloth jews accepted arabs rejected frustrated the british gave up and passed the problem to the un for the un plan numerically you are correct to in the jews favor but lets look at what the entailed all of the highlands meaning all of the arable farmland except half of the jezrael valley the more fertile half stayed in the arab portion all of the potable water including the aquifers that fed into the jewish portion except the kineret all of the jewish holy sites except for safed and tiberias the jewish portion was what was offered in map of the woodhead commission plus an empty portion of negev the populated part was given to the arab portion israel had always the intention to colonize the other territory if not then why are there illegal settlments in the west bank they shouldn t be there they are being used as a cynical political weapon by a criminal likud government whose leader will more than likely be voted out and jailed in besides the gaza disengagement proved how temporary they can be settlements fully evacuated and demolished and jews moved out of gaza back into israel hopefully as a part of a more concrete peace plan the majority if not all will be done away with as well they should start with kfar tapuach a disgusting cesspit of fascist kahanists israel is not willing to compromise as we speak its still bombing palestinians and arresting palestinians in the west bank all the groups from the al aqsa martyrs brigade to izz ad din al qassam brigades abu ali moustaffa brigades omar al qassem forces lions den etc all have as a part of their ideology the yearning for shahada it very conveniently gives them the impetus to put headquarters arms and materiel even attack staging areas in schools hospitals and mosques and they make damn sure that they remain active for them its a win win either they get to kill jews or palestinians die and it makes the jews look bad some have gotten to the point of thinking no matter what happens we will be hated people are going to die anyway in this exchange better it be them than us it is a nasty place to be and nobody wins in that place dont chose to be blind to genocide just because its not happening to your people no words have meanings the palestinian population has increased times since that is not genocide after the shoah the jewish population to this day still has not returned to the level it was at in people are dying innocent people scores of them and it is a shame that must never be forgotten but no genocide of a people comes with a population growth there were violences from both sides since the british mandate but that doesnt mean all jews or all palestinians are bad agreed wholeheartedly a very good palestinian friend of mine

anti zionist is by definition a hardcore racist anti zionism depends crucially on explicitly racial doctrines please do lell me if sam harris is an antisemite no he isn t nor is he an anti zionist afaik sam harris rejects the bible as forming the bible for a valid claim to territory that undercuts a key christian zionist argument in favor of zionism disagreeing with one argument in favor of something is not the same as joining a wholly alien ideology that exists in opposition to it if i reject biden s argument about corporate gauging being the cause of inflation that doesn t make me an

minute lecture by anti zionist rabbi yaakov shapiro and i actually learned a lot no sorry pro palestine i didn t come out of it less of a zionist but i do understand better how people arrive at anti zionism while telling themselves it has nothing to do with antisemitism shapiro s main claim is this judaism is only a religion nothing more according to him jews aren t a people or a nation just individuals obligated to mitzvot in his view once we stop fulfilling those commandments our identity disappears israel therefore isn t a continuation of jewish tradition it s a replacement for it a national identity invented to secularize and normalize the jew that s his argument and i kind of agreed with some of it he cited quotes from early zionist thinkers some of which are downright horrifying calling diaspora jews parasites weaklings even shameful there s no denying that many of zionism s early architects were desperate to escape the stereotype of the ghetto jew and create a new jewish archetype muscular militant sovereign it wasn t pretty it was in part a reaction to centuries of humiliation but here s the contradiction that shapiro and anti zionists in general never quite resolve they reject jewish peoplehood but they exclusively speak about jews as a collective when it comes to criticizing israel they claim zionism is political not religious but then accuse israel of corrupting judaism they say israel doesn t represent the jewish people while simultaneously demanding that jews worldwide answer for israel s actions it s a dance of denial erasing peoplehood when it s inconvenient then weaponizing it when it s useful and it misses something deeper for the average zionist like me the belief isn t that jews deserve a state because we re better it s that every jewish story whether in morocco ukraine iraq germany or ethiopia ended the same way and then they turned on us zionism didn t erase judaism it gave it political teeth it said your torah doesn t need to be studied in exile forever your prayers don t have to rise up from someone else s basement you don t need to ask the pope or the czar or the king for permission to live yes some early zionists said awful things yes zionism was messy arrogant and sometimes wildly misguided but even in all their ideological chaos they built the one thing that every other jewish survival strategy failed to produce sovereignty we re not always at our best when we run the show we ve made mistakes but at least we have a show to run so no i m not disillusioned i m more resolved and i m grateful i watched the video it reminded me of something important zionism isn t perfect but it was never meant to be it was just meant to give jews one place on earth where our safety wasn t up for debate where our

they proudly present themselves as anti zionism almost everyone who s anti zionism will have no idea what you re talking about they hold that zionism is bad and israel doesn t have a right to exist which contradicts your argument further you claim the protests are against kahana zionism which didn t exist when israel became a state even the revisionist were a small minority in the zionist movement the labour were the majority and the main leadership so if the anti zionism is not against the jewish self determination then why are they against israel s existence you can play with language all you want but to the masses anti zionism means anti zionism and that is putting aside that s your definition isn t quite correct about what the kahana and revisionist zionists believe']"

they watched the oct massacres livestreamed and screaming bloody murder the minute israel started striking back killing and expelling million jews from their ancestral homeland would be righteous justice to them but striking hamas in its urban strongholds is an act of genocide especially if even a single civilian is hurt even the un is in on it acting like hamas terrorists feed themselves by meditating until food and medicine manifests itself out of thin air inside the tunnels and refusing to admit what they do with the aid that s supposed to be going to desperate civilians some people use the excuse that us tax dollars and consumer purchases help to finance and supply israel s war machine sure thing are canadian belgian and french taxes also going to israel and as to left wing american motivations there s a big country across the pacific called china that s currently erasing an entire muslim community of millions from its xinjiang province by throwing them into concentration camps and surgically inserting prosthetics into the women that prevent them from being able to have children china is now the second largest foreign source of imports to the us only slightly behind mexico where are the calls for a boycott where were the protests against russia iran and hezbollah when they backed bashar assad to torture and slaughter half a million syrian civilians and permanently displace another million don t piss on my leg and tell me it s raining there s something seriously rotten going on here and the stench is carrying for thousands of miles it s pretty obvious a very large number of protesters know less about middle eastern history than they know about the stone age from watching the flintstones ignorance only partially explains what s going on here though as with the anti jewish pogroms of the past us jews are once again being portrayed as a globally privileged class of elite scheming to suck the rest of the world dry this time by exploiting americans to do all the dirty work for us my sincere impression at this time is that jews are being singled out and scapegoated for the west s own oppressive colonial history radical leftists of european descent throughout the west feel a sense of guilt over what their own ancestors once did so what better way to wash it all away than to help some brown people do the same thing to white people somewhere else and call it even likewise my impression is that radical western leftists of non european descent feel a sense of shame and humiliation over how their ancestors were once subjugated by white colonists and are seeking to have it done in reverse to other whites as an act of self assertion and redemption if anyone disagrees with my take on the matter please explain to me the discrepancies and self contradictions i cited above and what the real reasons for them are just recently i saw someone on a canadian subreddit calling canadian synagogues idf recruitment centers like sure and meanwhile all the mosques in the country are universally and thunderously preaching that democracy and religious freedom for all should be protected and defended to the death especially for the people who criticize religion altogether and especially in countries where muslims are the majority it s completely out of control we ve seen this movie before german christians and jews got along absolutely swimmingly until happened and someone needed to be blamed for the kaiser losing his war', 'your argument is based on is the presumption that all palestinians know which palestinians are hamas and which aren t and therefore can make a conscious choice to help them or not based on the motivations you have ascribed you go further to assume that palestinians must be with them if they re not vocally against them i m just going to say that s a ridiculous notion do you think members of the ira fln red army faction mukti bahini french resistance or viet cong wandered around town announcing to everyone who they were when doing their groceries no of course they didn t they tried to keep their identities relatively hidden so they could go about the business of militancy do you think hamas is stupid enough to have believed that before the war and currently israel didn t have some kind of intelligence gathering operation going on in gaza they will obviously have taken some kind of step to hide their identity so let s say you re a palestinian year old and some guys who just moved into your apartment building ask you to help load some boxes into their car you don t know the boxes are full of aks but you want to be a good neighbour so you help them you have no idea these people are hamas are you a complicit terrorist in fact let s take that further the guys have moved into your apartment building except now you know they re hamas now you are aware that there s some violent guys with aks living on your doorstep and they re asking you to help load some boxes you just want to go to school and play fifa in peace so you help them with the boxes to get it over with and go about your business because you don t want any trouble are you now a complicit terrorist let s take that even further same neighbours but this time you actually actively hate hamas you know they re hamas you know they re violent they ask for help with the boxes you ve got your mom and sister to look after what now endanger your family or help with the boxes are you a complicit terrorist one more for good measure same as the last one but this time they ask you to keep a box because they re running out of space what do you do are you going to shoot them your mom and sister are going to get murdered in that case are you a complicit terrorist the fact of the matter is the dynamics of aiding and abetting hamas are so much more complex than being pro or against and it s the gross simplification of these dynamics that s being used to justify the wholesale slaughter of people that often don t have any other choice because half the time they re being lied to or coerced seriously if you don t like hamas what are you going to do defect to israel don t get me wrong i m sure there are some pro hamas true believers around but most of the population weren t even around or were small children when they got into power in the first place and then we have these small children who may be knowingly and willingly helping hamas do you think they re in possession of all their faculties or do you think they re being taken advantage of like all other child soldiers in the world and if they aren t why is your side not actively putting your ire and activism toward their captors hamas my ire and activism is against hamas i freely speak out against hamas but the reality is that hamas doesn t have widespread international support from western governments and it s already understood that most reasonable people don t endorse the rape and pillage of innocents in opposition israel is slaughtering an astonishing number of innocents and blatantly trying to hide something why is international press not allowed to enter the conflict zone like they have been in conflicts like ukraine iraq afghanistan nagorno karabakh etc it s obvious to any observer that the civilians are being slaughtered either through willful intent to harm or callous indifference as we speak my country and my taxpayer money is supporting this your turn to answer the question i posed in the op let s get this discussion back on track', 'the knee jerk support for hamas on social media you ve seen it as much as i have i m sure people who claim to support human rights and democracy creating social media posts in support of hamas they seem to have a lot of misconceptions that hamas are a bunch of peace loving freedom fighters who are out to protect palestinian human rights as opposed to the fundamentalists that they are that israel occupies gaza israel left gaza and then people there promptly voted hamas into power this of course led to the blockade which has led to untold suffering for many palestinians but does anybody in their right mind think they wouldn t do the same if they were israel how would the us react if isis set up shop in baja mexico how would egypt react or china i think the answer is the same that israel is some colonizer and imperialist please please please please show me the mighty israeli empire have these folks ever looked at a map can they even find israel i admit it is kinda hard to find considering it is smaller than the size of new jersey how do these people not see the irony in calling one of the world s smallest countries a colonizer these people seem to be especially confused about what is being colonized is it all of israel including its internationally declared and recognized borders is it the territories conquered in the six day war in this conflict israel was facing a military mobilization from syria egypt iraq lebanon and jordan all at the same time please again you tell me what you would do if you were a very tiny country surrounded on all sides by governments who were holding rallies declaring they would sweep the jews into the sea actually study the conflict and look into the history of this war and you tell me with a straight face who was the aggressor but israel is a european implant in the middle east these people would declare right tell that to the more than of israelis who are from middle eastern countries including iraq egypt syria lebanon etc my wife and her entire family walked from iraq after being kicked out of baghdad in the s it is not the case that middle eastern countries were friendly and tolerant of jews and it is the case that israel would not be a viable state without it having become a safe haven for middle eastern jews i m sorry that this complicates the colonizer narrative but again history matters let me say on this point there is of course legitimate criticism of israel that is not anti semitic just as there is legitimate criticism of any country but for those of you reading this who are confounded when your criticism is met with accusations of antisemitism this is why it would seem that every nation on earth is entitled to national liberation except for jews when you call a group who fought and won its independence a colonizer you re denying their right to exist but the occupation let me say at the outset of this last part i oppose the occupation the occupation of the west bank is unequivocally wrong it could have and should have been done with a long time ago just like when the sinai was returned to egypt in exchange for peace it really is too bad that ehud barak offered the entirety of the west bank and gaza to yassir arafat at camp david in and all that israelis got in return was the nd intifada more violence more terrorism more slamming the door on a long term solution people seem to have some amnesia or historical ignorance around this as well do you really think that israel has some sort of imperative to just control the west bank for the sake of it now years later ehud barak s party and really the entire peace camp people who believe a solution can be worked out with the palestinians is really dead so now you get netanyahu and he really does seem content to build more settlements and annex the west bank it s a shame but it s hard not to see how things could have worked out differently how about if arab leaders accepted the partition plan what if they made peace with israel in instead of amassing their armies on the border what if they had done with egypt did in brokering peace in return for the west bank and gaza what if the pa had accepted the camp david accords it would seem that it is still true that the palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity what if in palestinians would recognize that hamas can not and should not speak for them if there is ever to be peace people who live democracy peace and human rights don t go door to door murdering civilians and taking hostages and if you feel this need to defend them i feel you are under some very severe delusions']"

necessarily extensions of another country america was a colony of britain yet people immigrated from all sorts of country coming to america similarly palestine was a colony of britain and colonists immigrated from all sorts of countries both series of immigration happened generally against the will of the local population once both colonies gained independence colonialism didn t stop and both countries expanded their borders in further acts of colonialism additionally both groups maintained systems whereby the colonists maintained dominance within society after israel dismantled their settlements in gaza hamas generally stopped firing rockets into israel they resumed firing rockets in response to israel killing an innocent family picnicking on a beach the wikipedia page on the gaza israel conflict also provides a nice summary in the background section of course it s just wikipedia so take it as you will also while israel did dismantle settlements in gaza settlements have been expanding at a far faster pace since then in the west bank the indigenous people of palestine are the people who were living on the land pre zionist immigration british colonialism this includes jews though these jews have been accepted at this point as part of the colonizers which separated them from the experiences of other indigenous groups many anti zionists pro palestinians don t think jews should have to leave israel i strongly disagree with anyone who believes that they should have to leave', 'you re repeating a fabricated narrative with no historical basis the idea that palestinians somehow colonised their own land is absurd palestinians are the indigenous people of the region with overwhelming historical and archaeological evidence confirming their continuous presence for centuries before zionist settlement began in the late th and early th centuries the claim that most of the arabs in gaza are originally egyptian is a myth pushed by israeli nationalists to delegitimise palestinian identity serious historians israeli palestinian and western have thoroughly debunked it the majority of palestinians in gaza are refugees or the descendants of refugees who were forcibly expelled from cities like jaffa haifa and beersheba during the nakba in they didn t colonise gaza they were driven into it through ethnic cleansing if you want to talk about colonisation look at the movement that openly described itself as colonial theodor herzl wrote in his diary about establishing a jewish colony in palestine under european sponsorship vladimir jabotinsky the ideological father of likud admitted that zionism required forcibly displacing palestinians zionist militias expelled massacred and dispossessed hundreds of thousands of palestinians to create a state on top of their land that is what colonisation looks like and as for the claim that jews and arabs lived in peace for centuries that s actually somewhat true until european zionists arrived with the explicit goal of creating an ethnically exclusive state jewish communities had lived in the middle east for thousands of years alongside their muslim and christian neighbours the tensions we see today weren t inevitable they were the direct result of a settler colonial project that displaced one people to benefit another if you actually want to engage with serious history read israeli historians like ilan papp who documents how zionism was built on ethnic cleansing or palestinian scholars like rashid khalidi who traces the destruction of palestinian society so i ll ask you what historians have you read what sources have shaped your perspective because if your understanding comes from nationalist propaganda rather than serious scholarship then you re not engaging with history you re just repeating a political narrative', 'palestine had a real existing living population of palestinians who weren t some newcomers it was their land i think you will find that the pot is calling the kettle black here doing the exact same thing to the equally indigenous palestinians when returning centuries or millenia later isn t colonialism most fled of their own accord during the nakba those who stayed make up of israel the colonial brits were one of the biggest forces in driving the jewish nation state into the levant the colonial arabs are the biggest driving force in creating a palestinian nation state into the levant who is or isn t a colonizer isn t about some incredibly vague notion of who was there first it s about the dynamics of exploitation and force in the now colonialism is a practice of domination which involves the subjugation of one people to another explain to me why arab israeli s have full citizen rights meanwhile jews living in arab countries were subjugated right to take by force any parcel of land where they can argue they have some sort of genetic cultural historical religious emotional connection to this is how all countries are made including those arguing for the creation of a state called palestine which has never actually existed i generally believe that people should freely live where they wish with the caveat that this cannot happen on the expense of the basic human rights of others i agree and it s great that israel gives full citizen rights to arab israeli s meanwhile this would not be reflected in a hamas run palestinian state nothing colonial about peacefully immigrating to an already existing community purchasing a bit of land via legal means from the locals or whatever and living in a way that doesn t endanger the lives and rights of the people who were there before you that is what they did until certain palestinian s endangered the lives and rights of jews i can see why jews wanted to govern themselves especially since the arab s declared war on them first including nations that weren t from the region egypt lebanon iraq transjordan syria saudi arabia yemen in an ideal world both jewish and palestinian would be able to return and live in safety and peace wherever in the levant i personally believe that one secular one state in israel palestine would have the best chances of leading

an anthropologist race is a societal structure based on phenotypic traits because arab jews and muslim arabs stem from the same gene pool they exhibit similar traits ur gonna tell me that a fucking syrian jew is not gonna be labeled as arab with brown skin dark curly hair and phenotypic traits common in the middle east jews are an ethnoreligion because of their gene variation and isolation due to their very specific diaspora ashkenazi can also make the case for being a race and ethnic group since they all descended from people post dark ages they have traits more commonly presented due to their limit of outside genes over centuries this also led to an increase in genetic disorders found disproportionately more amongst ashkenazi jews specifally race is literally how you look and how the general public will perceive you call them what you want but if they re brown they will be labeled as so in america people are stupid hence why indians in turbans were getting beat up after while all jews are semitic there is so much genetic drift and that their gene pools exhibit specific traits commonly hence why i quoted famous jewish comedian ari shafir you can pick out ashkenazis out of a line up most of the time there is nuance to this convo', 'and this response is probably going to cover most replies i got except the guy who said it was misinformation and that i was talking about the khazar theory when i didn t compare ashkenazi jews with the khazars i do hope that guy knows that the ashkenazi jews popped into the population around years ago they were an isolated community of people who traded on the silk road and started speaking yiddish because of all the different languages on the trading route they literally come from north eastern t rkiye around the mountains near iran like people who probably ended up there during one of the exiles and they stayed eventually migrating to central and eastern europe and around the rhine river i m not looking back but i don t think i made a comparison to the khazars because the little khazar story of their conversion to judaism is a little record of letters or other communications betweena spanish rabbi and the khazar king he was looking for a religion but didn t know anything about the abrahamic religions so the king sees the rabbi a priest and a sheikh to help him find out what religion to choose he asked the christian priest which religion he should definitely not choose the priest said islam i mean the first books of the holy bible is the hebrew bible so next the khazar asks the sheikh which religion he thinks he should definitely not choose the sheikh said christianity i don t know why but maybe because the priest threw islam under the bus first so the khazar then told them that by their own words he should not choose either one of them so he chose judaism and just to blow you out of the water with your thoughts on me saying ashkenazi jews is the khazar theory ashkenazi from the north east part of t rkiye and mountains along with border lands in persia iran the khazars are from the caspian sea countries along with ukraine russia bulgaria crimea kazakhstan and mongolia too among other countries too plus the western part of t rkiye not north east like the ashkenazi jews i have spent the day replying to you guys because apparently you have been lied to all your life or get confused like i did in the beginning of my studies but i have been a history buff for around years and biblical history of the religions longer than october th i will read the rest later but right off the bat you claim that i was speaking about khazars and the debunked theory that i never believed because i like using resourceful and credible sources like jewish learning and the bible and the qu ran along with archaeological digs and research data genetics real information even if it doesn t go along with my beliefs or theories btw i love conspiracy theories and i helped solve a couple in the last year

ve linked refer to studies on all jewish groups ashkenazi jews have been extensively studied over the last years and their origins are nearing full resolution ashkenazi jews are remarkably genetically homogeneous due to a genetic bottleneck in the middle ages ashkenazi jews are a mixture of levantine middle eastern and european ancestries it is beyond any reasonable doubt from autosomal and ydna evidence that ashkenazi jews have significant middle eastern genealogical descent and ancestry which is manifested in genetic markers which are close to lebanese syrian druze palestinian kurdish and other middle eastern groups ashkenazi jews have considerable shared ancestry with other jewish groups including sephardic and mizrachi jews which predates the jewish diaspora the most recent autosomal estimates of ashkenazi ancestry from full genome sequencing and using modern refernce populations from the near east and europe indicate they are approximately middle eastern and european some recent autosomal analyses such as xue et al indicate that ashkenazi jewish european ancestry is predominantly southern european with a smaller degree of eastern european admixture groundbreaking research still in abstract form and not released in full by shai carmi et al on ancient caananite dna sequenced from bone fragments at archaeological sites in israel which serves as a better proxy for ancient near eastern populations than modern levantine populations who were likely impacted by the arabic expansion and other admixture events indicate ashkenazi jews can trace approximately of their ancestry to the ancient near east more than of ashkenazi patrilineal ydna clades are from the near east indicating strong direct middle eastern patrilineal ancestry the maternal ancestry from mtdna clades of ashkenazi jews is debated by the scientific community and there is not a firm consensus as to whether they are predominantly from the near east as put forward by karl skorecki and doron behar or from europe as put forward by marta d costa the genetic evidence ydna mtdna and autosomal dna does not support a khazar origin for ashkenazi jews sources']"

palestinians this literally doesn t make any sense first of all israelis are the ones who elected bibi and his far right government into power years ago trying to blame pro palestinian voters in

gallant well before anybody knew what the results were gonna be for the election after a long conflict bibi had with gallant had for over a year now well before the elections the only link between the two events might be that netanyahu chose election day to fire gallant assuming people would be too distracted to notice or critique a controversial decision like this but it has nothing to do with how pro palestinians voted as they simply didn t know and as an israeli american i blame you you deluded yourselves into thinking kamala was complicit in a genocide or that there even was one because you do t know what the term even means and held your votes knowing full well what trump was gonna do for netanyahu if he won you fucked over american and israeli democracy and in that process you fucked over the people you swore you cared about and all of it was because you hate israel s existence more than you cared about palestinians uh no i highly doubt you can explain how pro palestinian voters are somehow responsible for kamala losing arab and muslim americans make up a tiny percentage of the american population and even if every single one of them voted for her in michigan or the swing

american money drives large projects in gaza as israel is simply incapable of solving any of its territory issues but i completely disagree with the displacement of palestinian people about the current situation here are my thoughts trump has never been loyal to what he says he s not a politician he s an anti politics and business negotiation junky i never see him through the lens of political common senses this plan is so obviously infeasible mainly because of the relationship w saudi arabia and the possible future military expenses in the middle east it s about a lot of dollars that trump needs to rebuild great america the trump s plan is not without risks and losses and no way that the old crook is unaware about it he is plunging beyond the boundary intentionally and he always has now with this obviously stupid plan people will come up with all kinds of alternatives trump only has to pick one that comes at the top who needs to spend on policy research when all those smart people love to work voluntarily for their own country for free meanwhile he parade as a pro israel pro zionism figure allowing netanyahu to gain back some political support not sure how much or what netanhyahu paid or will pay for this but that ain t go cheap for sure also i think trump is already trying to negotiate w palestine if palestine ever chooses to participate for one thing trump would ve already thought about utilizing palestinians as a cheap workforce but mentioning it by himself would put him in a lower position forcing him to pay palestinians more overall i think it s better for palestine to start talking with trump the point is in the talking itself not agreeing nor disagreeing i think trump is going after the nobel peace prize again p s apr lots of zealots

external person just to run the second one seems pretty legit to me why did israel not do anything about it they did all the approvals for all unrwa members and they have a pretty capable security system i can accept that of k slipped through but thousands seems quite unrealistic unwatch yup did some reading on their website over some time would you consider them more or less biased than the un they seem pretty one sided to me so not a great source for objective truth you appreciate the idea of segregation of duty i am sure we do not ask a sales person for their own performance report for example we go to a seperate finance team for that also did you notice an error on their report regarding unrwa funding did you read that report regarding the current status of the us aid the article was a month after the us had reinstated it s aid and the article was quite precise about the other funding from the other countries yet it did not specify that the us aid had been restarted even though it did for everyone else where it was true i checked maybe of them this made it look somehow that the us was supporting the israeli position a little by delaying its restart of funding even though others had already could have been a mistake looks more like propaganda we won t know so unwatch whilst it may have some genuine reporting it does not appear to be a credible source for all facts', 'palestinians overall is unclear but the leaders of the groups would absolutely have pushed for it because they insisted they would do so and even without uniting did so of course the victims would be palestinians israel blocks them off from attacking israelis by doing this the un has no genuine power anymore and it s incorrect to say that they have more un violations what they have is people from the un who said israel violated the rules but from israel s perspective in the cases where individual people did break the rules israel punished them so israel is not in violation what you re talking about is two different interpretations of the same international law israel interpreted it for their own situation and insists that that interpretation does not fall over the line their opponents insist otherwise but this is a case of sovereign nations arguing with each other the opponents are not allowed to enforce their interpretation of international law while israel itself still insists it has not violated it unless they actual have proof of israel breaking its own standards and not prosecuting the violation iirc that was the problem they had figured out when prosecuting germany that it was only when the country in question wouldn t do anything about the violation that it was a problem at any rate they still haven t found proper proof of them violating it only conjecture and false premises see issues with the ipc document at the same time as my dad put it the un even without the power is still important since it s a place for people to air grievances publicly between countries better they do that than plot in private just to preempt you i m sure you ll say yeah but israel is committing war crimes so i ll respond to that immediately israel is committing acts of war some of those acts committed by individuals with or without orders will be considered war crimes by israel in such a case all the people involved get investigated and prosecuted there is no war without war crimes but israel s war does not include a lack of prosecution for said crimes and that makes it a proper war as well there is an additional position while i don t agree fully with the person who shared the video i do agree with the position itself see this']"

iron dome couple of problems with that hamas doesn t have the billions in funding that the us provides isreal in order to build it even if they did they couldn t get the materials necessary to construct it through the current israeli blockade now assuming those two very impossible objectives could be cleared it took the idf years to build the iron dome do you think the idf wouldn t bomb the shit out of a missile launching device before completion given that long amount of time to act also important to note the iron dome isn t designed to defend against sophisticated ballistic missiles isreali aircraft launch at palestinian apartment complexes its primary use is against mortars and simple rockets the iron dome would defend against nothing if palestine had one', 'the overwhelming majority of hamas missiles are metal and propellant and little else they can inflict damage if they hit someone almost directly but more often than not will cause a small hole in the sidewalk or punch a hole in a tiled roof some apparently use a fertiliser based head that can ignite rather than explode on impact but most do not you can rest assured that if they did have explosive capacity the damage in israel would be considerably worse israelis insist that the reason why there are so few israeli casualties is because of iron dome iron dome s makers claim a success rate of although historically it has been far lower than that and the data for success rates come from the idf s press department in it was reported that iron dome had intercepted out of rockets that is a success rate of note in the past missile defense experts have expressed massive scepticism about iron s dome s effectiveness and crucially nobody else is rushing out to buy it notably no purchases from gulf states concerned about iran india about kashmir azerbaijan ukraine etc israel claims hamas has fired missiles in this latest outbreak at an success rate for iron dome we would expect to see some considerable damage missile damage sites at a success rate you would expect to see landing sites you won t see anything like this in the israeli press pictures of hamas rocket strikes are rarer than hen s teeth ostensibly israel censors pictures of hamas rocket damage because it does not want to reveal landing locations the reality is there isn t much to show there will be no major rebuilding of anything in israel even if the idf s own press release data effectiveness of iron dome were actually true which it almost certainly is not hamas missiles do the same job that israel s non lethal roof knockers do even allowing for the fact they have no guidance system and some will land in fields the sea etc israel s press censor blacks out mentions of landing sites almost completely israel knows that it is crucial to keep the framing that a hamas missile is what people expect a modern projectile with high explosives detonated on impact capable of taking down a building the other day in typical bothsideism the bbc showed a multistory building in gaza reduced to rubble before adding that in israel hamas rockets were causing damage showing a flooded israeli apartment and a scene of a road accident in tel aviv where a man had died because of something to do with rockets other examples of people hamas missiles have killed include an old lady injured running for a bomb shelter i do not want to trivialise hamas missiles but they are so qualitatively different from the popular view of missile that their description is deliberately misleading it is central to israel s framing to focus on the missile counts and implictly treat its rockets tonne high explosive modern ordinance as equivalent to hamas rockets crude homemade affairs that cause disquiet in israel but cause little damage the propaganda dutifully repeated ad infinitum is that all missiles matter and the only difference between what the israel does and what hamas does is success in other words israeli propaganda basically tells israelis that if it weren t for iron dome bomb shelters etc that the horrific pictures they see of whole gazan families buried under rubble would be their fate from hamas missiles this is patently bullshit israeli sniper rounds are also missiles and do far more damage than hamas missiles apparently they don t count even though israel routinely fires into gaza and maimed more than palestinians in one year alone where hamas does have more success is the use of mortars which it uses more sparingly and mostly against military targets near gaza these are routinely referred to by the media as rockets but they aren t iron dome is ineffective against mortars mortars only work at short ish range but do contain explosives and are deadly when they hit a target', 'why tollerate rocket attacks because iron dome when arguements how israel should more proportionally react to gazan s attacks the arguement kept being made that israel should just accept the rocket attacks because it has iron dome and gazan does not i ve also read that israel should shut iron dome down for the fight to be fair i think it s pretty self explanatory why this reasoning is bullshit but i will do so anyway because people seriously appear to believe it a israel has the iron dome because it uses its aid to invest in self defense gaza does not have iron dome because it doesn t invest in self defense only in weapons and terror tunnels b iron dome only has a success rate which amounted to peope killed and people injured in may alone c operating iron dome is not exactely cheap israel is dedicating a significant amount of its budget to it which they could better spend elsewhere but can t d iron dome doesn t protect from psychological damage of kids in southern israel have ptsd depression and miscarriages are also high e a war is not a sport where every time needs to be subjected to the same rules every country is entitled to using the advantages it has this is especially true for a victim like israel that is only defending itself edit f iron dome also only intercepts rockets that would hit civilian targets rockets that would only hit non residential areas are allowed to land and cause damages damags that israel then has to repair x b so why do people claim israel is not the victim just because it has iron dome how do they seriously expect israel to shut it down to make the squabble

palestinians this only ensures that the cycles of violence and suffering will continue no what will ensure the cycle continues is if hamas is not deposed they have already promised to do a repeat of oct', 'did you know did you know that the gaza strip has been independent since did you know that the west bank also has some independence and they have their own authority that sets the rules and their own police did you know that besides the illegal settlements of the israelis most of the settlements are in the territories where there is israeli not palestinian control there are also illegal settlements of palestinians in the west bank region did you know that the israeli government is exposed to a lot of criticism and loathing from the citizens and that is why every week before the war there were huge protests by the citizens did you know that idf soldiers are also children young people the israeli army is recruited after high school the average age of female soldiers is and of male soldiers is did you know that idf soldiers were caught helping palestinians and playing football with children did you know that there was an arab supreme judge in israel who put a jewish prime minister and president in israeli prison not so apartheid huh in the survey of palestinians from the gaza strip support hamas that is more than half of the citizens likewise in the hamas videos where they bring the israeli hostages into gaza citizens were seen cheering them on in the hamas videos it can also be seen that many palestinian residents entered israel and helped hamas loot rape and set fires in homes in the following link support for hamas is indicated of palestinians from the west bank support armed organization against israel and in fact do not believe in a two state solution dcb abe dbbe the palestinian residents send their children to a hamas camp where they learn from a young age how to kill jews and take an idf soldier captive hamas had previously kidnapped an israeli soldier in and israel returned him in in exchange for the release of security prisoners including hundreds of life prisoners that is terrorists in the attack on hamas killed more than people and until now not all the bodies have been found that is the number is only increasing people are still being held captive in an unknown condition including children and babies did you know that until the war israel financed most of the electricity and water in gaza did you know that israel also assisted with complex medical treatments one of the abductees in gaza coordinated such treatments and led palestinian citizens to israel in order to receive treatment did you know that people from gaza worked in the territories of israel every day israel allowed this to increase the employment rate in gaza did you know that in people have access to electricity all the time do you donate for them too did you know that billion people in the world do not have access to potable water billion people around water development report released wednesday do you donate for them too', 'the cycle of radicalism disclaimer this is not intended in any way to justify hamas war crimes or transgressions rather to offer an alternative view adopted by those in the war currently as well as some of my personal viewpoints as a palestinian refugee pro israel advocates often claim that no adult in the gaza strip is truly innocent or a legitimate civilian they typically argue that palestinians are collectively responsible for electing hamas or for supporting its actions on but this stance remains deeply problematic dehumanizing firstly it is important to acknowledge that given the harsh and dehumanizing conditions imposed by the israeli occupation e g restricted movement limited access to food water electricity expansion of illegal settlements in the west bank taking and treatment towards palestinian detainees etc radicalization was unfortunately for many an almost inevitable outcome consider this if your sister were killed by an israeli missile with no apology acknowledgment or third party investigation despite her having no direct ties to any militant group resentment toward the israeli military and in some cases even toward israelis more broadly would be an understandable human response it is precisely this cycle of aggression dispossession and dehumanisation that compels many in gaza to join or support hamas not out of inherent hatred for jews bloodlust but rather out of desperation grief and the absence of alternatives and the same applies for relatives of victims of hamas attacks in israel what the world viewed as terrorism many palestinians saw as a desperate bid to secure a future for their children in extreme conditions rational thought often gives way to emotion and survival instincts while external observers may approach such events analytically those living under siege are driven by fear trauma and hopelessness moreover holding extremist or even offensive political views does not justify extrajudicial killing supporting a terrorist organization while morally wrong should not be conflated with actively participating in violence there s a vital distinction between endorsing agreeance with an ideology and engaging in criminal acts for instance although neo nazism is universally condemned modern moral and legal frameworks still reject the idea of executing individuals simply for holding such beliefs the same standard must apply here belief alone is not a death sentence as a side note i view that israel has placed itself in a morally irredeemable position where even if it were to achieve its desired goal of eradicating hamas the remaining underlying conditions would give rise to a similar political entity differing only in name the people of israel will likely continue to live in fear and danger in the near future and it seems that so will the people of palestine unfortunately to end on a more optimistic note we need to remember that all people regardless of their politics deserve a chance to live free from occupation oppression and uncertainty regardless of religion ethnicity nationality etc p s please do not comment asking me for condemnations regarding the attacks we all recognise that such attacks involved atrocious transgressions and i especially condemn any harm directed towards innocent people women and children during such attacks and have no intention of justifying or condoning the murder or abuse of any innocent human being p p s wording this argument was extremely difficult and you would likely find the tone choppy if you have any objections or things i said that you would like me to reiterate or expand on please let me know']"

happen to literally anyone else however it is more likely to happen to people who are not cis white and straight then people who are idk i always come back to this quote first they came for the socialists and i did not speak out because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me martin niem ller while i haven t said this publically to anyone yet who s to say that america who has a history of being antisemetic wouldn t go after israel once they have more middle east territory we are providing them the weapons they are using and the funds billions of dollars we have a power advantage over them and yet nobody seems to really take that into consideration i believe with all my heart and soul that even if the genocide is completed more will come if obligations aren t met and if enough people radicalize due to what is happening this is awful but it would not surprise me if people see what netanyahu and the idf has done and conflate that to what all jews israelis support and want which is absolutely false yet people will argue that those who voted in hamas are to blame for what is happening to them which wasn t even the whole population who s to say no one would say that same thing against israelis jews that they all deserve harm because of the person they voted in causing harm what id like to see is an apology a ceasefire the acceptance of one another to be valid states without occupying one another and holding people accountable who try to push boundaries within their states with proper punishments israel making up the damages they ve done and the palestinians grieving next to israelis who suffered who did not want any of what has happened to happen if one wants more land they get it by purchasing it or coming to a conclusion to share states this is doable and it is necessary as both israelis jews and palestinians have people in the united states who would and could do harm if the wrong person gets into power as a trans masculine individual it is vital i stand next to those who also are targets of the patriarchy i would hope others could see that and follow i would be doing myself a disservice by not supporting blm other lgbtq individuals and their way of identifying themselves jews muslims palestine native americans pacific islanders etc', 'the reason why they went into the safe zones is because hamas was hiding the hostages there and also surrounding them it s really not anti islamic hatred a few years ago i realized that i knew absolutely nothing about islam and i just made instinctive assumptions that i did know anything about islam based on my understanding and knowledge of other religions and i heard so much conflicting info on it too obama even had an imam get on national tv to tell all of us islam does not hate gays imagine my surprise when i started studying it it was more than enlightening it was almost cathartic in a way i understood sooo much more about what was happening in the world and why i m a left leaning social democrat entirely progressive although also logical and not motivated by political identity issues obviously so i m not just going to believe something because i think i m supposed to and everything islam is i am not everything islam teaches and breeds and produces i do not want in the world islam to me is anti morality the heart of bigotry towards the jews is planted in islam let alone alll the other heinous shit in there it would make no sense at all for me to support islam in any way it s everything i hate basically i think it s essential to understanding this conflict also and why it exists and also why it won t ever be solved i know it s challenging for most people to comprehend that i can hate islam and not hate muslims i do wonder why anyone would want to support islam unless they believed in its fundamental tenants islam is just the law that muslims are supposed to live by they worship the same god as the jews as a matter of fact muhammad said he was the last messiah the jews rejected that notion and refused to convert or hold him up as a prophet and that s actually what started the hate and the wars between them muhammed immediately set out to ruin the jews reputation make them liars and cheats promise breakers etc he made them the number one enemy of islam in fact because why would he want anyone running around denying his claim to the prophethood muhammed basically tried to highjack the jew god and tried to ingratiate himself to the jews as their last prophet and messiah the jews knew that their messiah would have to be born a jew muhammed needed to quash any jewish scholar denying his reign and control and power etc think about this some illiterate bandit comes and says to these learned powerful rich men that he is their last messiah to join him because he has been visited by the angel of abraham and has come to spread the new law muhammed is telling the jews he is now their law on their religion he is the prophet of their god that s why muslims are taught to hate jews and not trust them and to kill them lol literally every jew needs to be murdered by muslims before islam can rule the earth and then the earth will know peace this is the entire end prophesy of islam for it to rule the earth this is also why they call islam a religion of peace because after islam conquors the world the world will finally know peace

to talk to me more i feel very isolated and betrayed lately and it brings me hope and comfort to know i am not alone in the journey i ve been on for the record it is my compassion for gaza that in large part drives my views and my outspokeness about how fucked the free palestine movement is years ago everyday gazans attempted to peacefully protest the abysmal economic conditions being imposed upon them the top leaders of hamas were worth a combined b while even prior to unemployment was at and the average income was about usd per month income tax could be up to hamas levies a fee on virtually every single financial transaction that happens in gaza etc the protests were brutally suppressed mass arrests torture and beatings in prisons protesters homes were broken into and trash protesters families were threatened with and sometimes suffered physical violence even amnesty international a notoriously anti israel acknowledges that all of this happen hamas torments women children religious and ethnic minorities political dissidents peaceful protesters etc they are one of the greatest authors of palestinian suffering on the planet and in the history i didn t see the west say a word not a single protest not a single social media post when my people were being beaten and tortured in dank prisons why do they only care about gazan suffering when jews are involved why wasn t the free palestine movement expressing mass solidarity via activism back then no jews no news from toddlerhood palestinian children are taught that martyrdom ought to be their highest aspiration the movement cares about none of this they ve accomplished exactly nothing to meaningfully improve everyday gazans day to day material conditions and that s because the movement is nothing more than a genocidal campaign being waged by the very people terrorizing the most vulnerable citizens of the middle east and northern africa also people love to say this didn t start in october until i say you re right let s talk about how jerusalem grand mufti al husseini had warm relationships of admiration with the hitler regime had an apartment in germany where he was treated quite lavishly by said nazi regime wrote about his desire to enact his own final solution once germany succeeded and the impact that has had on the palestinian consciousness then suddenly they don t want to talk about history anymore i have so much more to say on this i m getting ahead of myself i am so grateful for your post it is lonely over here but i have absolute unshakeable confidence that affirming israel s right to exist and resisting the islamic republic and their proxies is the right choice so here i stand anyway obviously i don t support everything israel does i don t have to i m just glad i m not

was coined by an avowed jew hater to differentiate his race based hatred from traditional styles of bigotry based on religion he chose that name because he wanted his idealogy to seem scientific as semites named after one of noah s sons from the bible were one of the main racial subgroupings of humanity according to th century racial pseudoscience outside of linguistics the term semite is completely deprecated the semitic language family just happened to be identified when it was still popular to use these descriptors and the relatedness of semitic languages is the one theory that still has any viability often the first term to describe a theory is the one that sticks around indefinitely in reality there is no such thing as a semite jews overwhelmingly have a portion of their ancestry from indigineous levantine populations but they are not descendants of semites neither are arabs egyptians amazigh assyrians etc no one is lastly but arabs are semites too is purposefully used to obfuscate the meaning of the term antisemitism it wasn t jews who started using the term but it was specifically coined as an exclusive descriptor of hatred towards jews personally i beleive jew hatred is a better term for describing bigotry and prejudice towards jews the false etymology that is attributed to antisemitism just increases the palitability of the term as it did in the past', 'there is a very famous quote by jean paul sartre that goes if the jew did not exist the antisemite would invent him there is another quote by a aurora levine a jewish poet from latain america that says something similar to if the peasants go on pogroms against their jewish neighbors they will never make it to the nobleman s house burn him out and seize the fields there is a lot of hardship in the world there is a lot of frustration there is a huge amount of unacknowledged bias and antisemitism that is systemic and it s really easy to blame the jew or focus on the jew as the disruptor of the perceived social order rather than the real structural problems of the perceived social order i feel like many people were just waiting for this point to feel justified in their jew hate and this gave them a socially acceptable way to do it just like wihelm in the past framing jew hate as antisemetism it is now being framed as antizionism like its a more palatable from of jew hate than the old antisemetic term its the wholesome diverse and inclusive jew hate its packaged really nicely and has a neat little word whose meaning and context has been usurped and twisted to have a meaning so vastly removed from it s original so that it suddenly is now a concept for all of the things that they re against all of the things they have told are bad now the hate is justified now everyone can all hold hands and sing kumbaya throw the jew in the sea sucks but its part of the pattern', 'most of the people who hate jewish people tend to hate other ethnic groups especially black people most antisemites don t hate jews per se antisemitism works differently from other kinds of racial hatred and is not straightforward i find sartre s anti semite and jew to be a very insightful essay into the matter he writes that the antisemite attributes all or part of his own misfortunes and those of his country to the presence of jewish elements in the community and proposes to remedy this by depriving jews of certain rights by expelling them or exterminating them sartre also finds that the antisemite is a prime example of a person who has entered into bad faith to avoid responsibility antisemitism is a way of feeling good proud even rather than guilty at the abandonment of responsibility antisemitism is a construct of a mutually exclusive concepts and jews are simultaneously semites non whites to the antisemite of the right and white to the one on the left communists to the right and capitalists to the left effeminate and weak to the neo nazi and strong ultra aggressive to the tankie etc whatever discontent one has with their society it is eventually found to have been caused by the jews jews brought the black plague jews caused the economic downfall of the weimar republic jews caused the bolshevik revolution jews oppressed the proletariat and threatened socialism etc this is a thousand year old tradition that has not disappeared every social crisis inevitably results in discovery of jewish culpability when american policemen shoot unarmed black men we discover the jews are truly culpable contrary to all evidence some activist says israel trained american police to use choking techniques therefore it must be true israel killed george floyd israel made american police use stop and frisk techniques too israel is culpable for american police brutality and jews who have never been seen as white by those for whom being white is a virtue are now seen as hyper white by those for whom whiteness is an unmitigated problem most antisemites don t realise they are antisemites and would swear on their lives they don t hate jews they are simply outraged at a social injustice that is inflicted by the jews when sending jews to the gas chambers germans sincerely believed they were serving social justice for the societal and economic downfall the jews inflicted on them these sentiments are now shifted to the jewish state the primary obstacle to world peace is israel the left has a very serious problem with antisemitism that stems from the influence of soviet political thought and propaganda and to be clear soviet antisemitism was influenced by nazi ideology which was influenced by the protocols making the far left and right the two sides of the same coin the modern far left would never admit how strongly influenced it is by the fsu but it will scream anti zionist slogans invented by kichko the fsu s ideological goebbels and later ivanov when accused of antisemitism the soviets replied zionist lies antisemitism is antithetical to socialism this is why the modern woke left will never scrutinise its fundamental concepts for antisemitism to do so is to destroy their whole worldview this is also why they are hyperaware of all kinds of structural oppression racism ableism sexism heteronormativity islamophobia etc but antisemitism is conspicuously absent from the discourse they want to believe a year old systemic problem disappeared in and could only be the fault of the far right critical race theory itself has an ideological jewish problem but to admit it is to destroy the worldview tldr anti semitism is an unsolvable problem

correct conclusion israel s creation required the violent expulsion of over palestinians from their homes and land that event is called the nakba it s a historical fact and you can t erase it by pointing to other atrocities remember the arabs have no more legitimate claim to the land than the jews they wanted a nation and one was offered to them they are the ones who declined the offer because they wanted it all you don t need to apologize for their xenophobia and antisemitism this narrative is false the indigenous palestinian population who were the vast majority obviously had a claim to the land they lived on the un partition plan was rejected because it was a colonial project that awarded of the land to a minority group that owned less than of it they didn t want it all they justifiably refused to have their country dismembered and given away by foreign powers framing their resistance as xenophobia is dishonest but today israelis are strong and any actions taken against the palestinian arabs is bullying bullying did you actually read the post you re replying to he s describing his comrades openly espousing nazi like ideology calling for holocaust to all arabs and he s witnessing his country commit what he rightly calls a genocide to describe that as bullying is a grotesque minimization of reality it s a pathetic attempt to make systematic slaughter sound like a minor scuffle why don t you work to improve things by joining a zionist pro palestinian organization this might be the most absurd part of your comment the op has reached a moral crisis because he understands that zionism the political ideology underpinning the state is the root of the problem a zionist pro palestinian organization is a fundamental contradiction that s like telling someone

because there are civilians let s say i m hiding tons of weapons in my basement and everyday i m going to say that i would unleash it at my neighbor what is my neighbor supposed to do by your logic nothing you probably would say something like it it didn t start on so here is my response in the s jews predominantly ashkenazi began purchasing land and properties across the region they didn t come to a land owned by palestinians and kick them out of their home like how you guys are saying arabs and jews lived under the ottoman empire but there was no such thing as a palestinians state your logic is more like if a mexican immigrants would kick americans our of their homes and take it out by force and establish another mexican state did you hear about palestine riots there was no jewish state no occupation whatsoever back then it was civil war under a different regime united nations partition plan for palestine the jews agreed the arabs refuse you would probably say something like the plan was in favor of the jewish people of the population was arab and were jews therefore the arabs rejected it unfortunately it wasn t something like we want more land let s negotiate or something it was more like let s kick all the jews in the region back to the sea they wanted to kick all of the jews from this area they didn t want any partition plan well that is the problem you don t understand the palestinians are the only people in the world where consequences of their actions don t matter the only people in the world with such luxury no consequences for their actions always blame the jews after the partition offer failed because the arab s plan of kicking the jewish people to the sea failed the israeli state was born what happened in was a part of the war the arabs started but there are no consequences for their actions whatsoever they wanted to kick the jews out of the land back then not because they were under a jewish occupation but because the jews were a problem for their ambitions of a muslim caliphate state did you know when the plo palestine liberation organization was founded israel didn t control the west bank and didn t control gaza back then their motive was simple kick the jews out of the land that is the only thing the palestinians had in common hating and wanting to kick the jews back to poland where they came from a nation of people was born out of a full hatred for another group of people their society was based on clans the only thing in common was hatred of jews and israel and even when israel offered the palestinians a state they reject it they reject anything israel even gave the palestinians the gaza strip completely and what they got in return rockets terror and war', 'do note i am a neutral rd party with no

precedent for what is transpiring now and hopefully you will reevaluate your statements one of the zionist movement s most liberal thinkers leo motzkin put it in our thought is that the colonization of palestine has to go in two directions jewish settlement in eretz israel and the resettlement of the arabs of eretz israel in areas outside the country the transfer of so many arabs may seem at first unacceptable economically but is nonetheless practical it does not require too much money to resettle a palestinian village on another land papp the ethnic cleansing a zionist home my lords

needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the arabs who now inhabit that ancient land mr balfour to lord curzon august public records office fo in short acceptance of the un partition resolution was an example of zionist pragmatism par excellence it was a tactical acceptance a vital step in the right direction a springboard for expansion when circumstances proved more judicious the zionist leadership was sufficiently pragmatic to understand the impracti cality of a jewish state in the whole of palestine with a population of arabs and jews nonetheless its territorial ambitions and its opposition to a palestinian state made jewish acceptance of the un partition proposal more formal than real simha flapan the birth of israel myths and

will be able to limit them simha flapan the birth of israel myths and realities new york pantheon the un s partition resolution was adopted on november and the ethnic cleansing of palestine began in

secondly it is impossible to get rid of hamas even in a hypothetical world if they do kill hamas do you not think there will be a replacement and think logically before you answer aside from hamas there are other existing militant islamist groups who are considered worse than hamas and also reside in gaza so once hamas is done they will be replaced and all the people that have lost loved ones will join this new group to seek revenge they have nothing left and lost everyone they cared for so what you have now is a group far worse in ideology and power than before isreal has to solve the root cause of the issue with a one state solution which is very optimistic and highly unlikely or they can stop gaza from being an open air prison before to leave gaza is near impossible things going in are monitored and controlled infact look at the starvation plus diet they implemented compare the before and after images of gaza this isn t a war on hamas it is clear that they are targeting

parroting amalek human animals is often misquoted or taken out of context by people looking for excuses to erase israeli self defense second let s talk about cannon fodder hamas deliberately embeds itself in civilian areas they fire rockets from hospitals mosques and schools they use human shields as a military strategy not because israel forces them to but because hamas decided their own people are expendable if it helps them win a pr war that s the definition of using civilians as cannon fodder the blockade it exists because hamas keeps importing weapons instead of food the occupation of gaza ended in when israel withdrew entirely what happened hamas took over and turned gaza into a terror factory instead of a functioning society as for administrative detention hamas isn t arresting suspects they re executing collaborators without trial hanging people in the streets or forcing year olds to carry weapons and your npr link is a weak flex negotiations collapsed because hamas demanded israel agree to end the war without removing hamas leadership after hamas murdered raped and kidnapped civilians no country on earth would accept that you can dress up this whole thing in human rights language but the truth is simple hamas started this war hides behind civilians and profits off every death and people like you pretend it s about resistance because it s easier than facing who the real oppressors of the arab palestinians are', 'hamas is crazy no doubt but the real issue is why does israel do a lot of the same stuff under the protection of statehood they can kill beat and imprison kids for throwing rocks without trial they do not let third parties investigate anything if it might expose their tactics they can call for wiping out arabs and the same rhetoric hamas has used against zionism at the same they created hamas as a political group to make sure that there can never be peace israel can bomb civilians instead of sending target strikes like they have done millions of times before they have not shown one picture of hamas hiding behind kids they got hamas elected and then they don t want them to be amongst people how are they supposed to govern i don t condone any of the killing of civilians or hamas in general but there were a lot of people who were not in hamas that came through the border and they definitely went on a revenge spree which is unacceptable hamas clearly showed they arent afraid to go after troops and were not afraid to glide under rockets and enter a state that has the most advanced weapons imaginable they took hostages and an occupied groups has a right to do that if they are also combatants like them isrsel could have traded the hostages the first day instead they are clearly focused on revenge and many israeli citizens died from helicopter strikes because they were told to shoot everything to get hamas on top of that they had to lie about babies and other crazy stuff as if what they did to civilians was insanely grotesque to begin with the zionist lobby and government has a real issue with lying and now because of social media they cannot control the narrative as well even many israelis are sick of the government and at right wing origins they turn words like holocaust and antisemitism into weapons for propaganda and disrespect all that happened while asking for similar genocides on by high level politicians and media i think the real issue is that america has protected israel for so long they don t care about what they do they never had consequences up until now the other issue is that it s clear they never wanted peace and created hamas for this reason now it s affecting all sides especially the israeli side who have never had to deal with violence the way palestinians have had to the government needs to be checked and criticized because they are making it less safe for israelis now they cannot kidnap kids at night because they have the same last name as a terrorist or go inside a mosque and tear gas people and then act surprised when gaza who have been terrorized for decades acts up you don t purposely create a situation then act like the victim and tell your people and the world we are just reacting and never did anything wrong it s insane there is no hamas in the west bank yet they took half the land now and terrorize people on a daily basis who mostly want to be let alone the mentality of people like netanyahu and the far right who have always controlled israel is that we cannot let them have anything because it leaves the chance they attack us therefore we have to beat them to a pulp all of them regardless of what they did then they double down when events like this happen and tell the world lies when they don t even have to there is no way around the palestinian problem but to want real peace because netanyahu is creating more extremism not just in palestinian land but across the me and world he will push it to the point where it becomes a holy war and will wish for the days when hamas was the only bad guy he threatens everything and achieves nothing the palestinians in israel will eventually outnumber jewish people and they cannot continue this way and expect to control everything by force everyone needs to wake up because we know hamas is bad but people need to realize they are a symptom of something much bigger that is

conversation in the first conversation he confided he didnt know who was ahmed fouad alkhatib he relies on what other protesters told him notice that ahmed fouad was respectful he greeted each participant by name he shook their hand or try to if they would allow it and thank them for the conversation in the dr ahmed s second conversation after having spoken to ahmed earlier after having gotten to know ahmed a bit more he said he jokingly said he was ghandi he is proposing a peaceful non violent path he also said at the end that he belives ahmed is a good person not a zionist like how other protesters said he was they misrepresented him to dr ahmed he was a smart person there were some points of agreements there were also points of disagreement after speaking to ahmed dr ahmed doesnt hate ahmed or sees him as the enemy he saw he was a fellow palestinian trying to save his people their methods may be different', 'i never said jews i was talking about the idf you used you how would the you apply if you were talking about the idf jewish people are just that people and the idf is an army with history of war crimes all armies that have actually fought have a history of war crimes singling the idf out like this is unfair and if there is a pattern like that antisemitic this is literally what this list is saying except for israel that somehow majority israeli opinion cannot he critiqued or you re an anti semite the list says no such thing the author of the post has heard me disagree with israeli majority opinion many times he doesn t consider me an antisemite treating the jewish people as a monolith is literally what anti semites do treating the jewish people as capable of making national decisions is what non antisemites do just as france china and the usa have policies jews have policies the instrument of jewish national expression is israel also chinese people dont call me racist when i attack their government and its policies and its history of oppression jews won t either when criticism of israel is fair and proportional finally i wouldnt say the jewish people like what israel is doing now i e being cozy with literal anti semites like orban or trump who apparently made the embassy move for evangelicals who see the jewish people as some victims of the rupture or some racist shit well you would be wrong the discussion among jews is whether israel is better off making cufi take top slot over aipac netanyahu made it clear he was gradually shifting towards cufi and israelis voted for him rather than assume israel is just evil maybe it would be worth asking why jews support those policies like you would for other countries and their policies i agree but this list is not just a critique its calling basically anyone with mild criticism of israel an anti semite that s simply false its calling people with unbalanced unfair and false criticisms of israel they wouldn t apply to other nationalities an antisemite there is literally jew hating anti semites out there condemning the occupation and the idf doesnt make you like them that s not on the list it leads to the us for example being worried about bds when an anti semitic trump lovign white supremacist opened fire on a synagogue killing innocent jewish people the trump loving shooter got the death penalty from trump supporters while bdsers with one exception haven t done anything similar they have frequently attacked jewish events in less serious ways when they do they aren t even charged with trespass harassment petty assault focus on the real threat the real threat is bds and let s not police speech like this you were the one asking me to censor the post you were asking for policing of speech', 'i agree with most of what you said with some counter points point today however in western society anti semitism is not tolerated it exists absolutely but people will call it out and fight against it this is the popular sentiment in the west rebuttal i believe indeed that if you ask anyone whether anti semitism is acceptable in the west they will answer no and if you ask them whether jews are evil separately they will most probably say no too however they will say very strange things as well for example if you don t want to avoid anti semitic crimes you should stop killing children or the general claim you should stop killing children as if my existence in general equals the death and murder of children that of course inherently causes problems and will of course have severe consequences in the future if it is not called out which it usually isn t this is not the only example but i don t think i need to provide a gigantic list and this one is good enough so in general the hate is still there but with a mask that mask is often anti zionism which feeds into the last point point that being said i don t think israel does itself a favor with the continuous injustice towards palestinians it is not able to keep a positive perception in the media with this behavior as we saw in the past years the broader public already had a more critical view of israel in the past except in the us and it s getting worse with every new human rights abuse rebuttal yes and no the view of israel is getting worse but i do not believe israel is solely to blame but in fact the stupid peace plans that keep popping up specifically from the international community if you ask for instance any israeli or palestinian whether they want a divided jerusalem they will unilaterally tell you no yet these are the plans the usually come out and it causes huge conflicts amongst jews and palestinians on how to divide an indivisible land on deciding who controls what israel is more powerful now but if the tides turn the brutality would not tone down because people are trying to lay claim to disputed territory human rights violation are happening on both sides and of course israel as the more powerful nation has more burden to solve the situation but the first step to a solution is actually to stop engaging with external pressures from interest groups such as the billion in aid the us gives to israel which forces them to adhere to us foreign policy and instead have honest conversations with each other on how to cohabit which is the only solution the one civilisation solution what people see palestinians or jews as probably will never be positive either way and so israel and palestine should try to stop the pr stunts and instead solve the conflict like big kids point we should not perpetuate that false belief by equating criticism towards israel with antisemitism rebuttal yes but criticism of israel as of any nation is of course totally valid and important in international affairs i do not however accept that the demonisation of zionism is fair considering the majority of jews consider themselves zionist it is actually at the core of judaism the desire to return to our homeland next year in jerusalem the breaking of the glass the tales of persecution etc etc etc jews have ever since the colonisation of their lands attempted to return to it we only know about zionism because it is the only attempt that succeeded so in general those that call themselves anti zionist the desire for jews to live in their native homeland are anti most jews simply put now on top of that it is often used as an excuse to say anything the same as when people say i am not racist but if you say that sentence you are probably racist so when people tell me anti zionism is not anti semitism firstly it is for the jews themselves to decide what is against their own aspirations and existence not the outside world but secondly this sentence usually occurs after some extremely anti semitic rant ps i am not accusing you of that i am just telling you my experience with this particular sentence in general i thank you for your post and hope you get back to me on this']"

that israel has a right to exist and to defend itself is moral when people say that they are not referring to israel dissolving itself by referendum but to answer your question and some of the ones you followed with to other users my stance interpretation is if that is the government their people chose then it s their right to pursue such the concept of self determination the nature of the government being the choice of the people the government is meant to serve is why such decisions are typically done by referendum the nature of such a referendum rds etc is what they establish either prior to it or by existing laws or tradition in many cases it is set in the constitution and determined by prior referendum such criteria are their own prerogative with no moral mandate on what it should be though i feel strongly it should require a supermajority of some kind rather than a simple majority such would be the government chosen by their people a rebellion by a subset of partisans is a different discussion entirely having multiple distinct peoples in a nation obviously complicates it as each have their own right to have a government representative of them as an american i am us centric in my perspective but that is why we have an additional requirement for states to ratify constitutional amendments such would be to me the optimal way of handling such in multi ethnic

of israel as they lived in a liberal democracy american jews have civil rights as americans but that is not national self determination self determination may not have to be synonymous with a dedicated ethnostate but most self determined states have this ethnic characteristic quebec isn t independent and it isn t an ethnostate per se but it still has a special status within canada with the right to preserve a particular french culture and heritage and if that were ever truly demographically threatened quebec would leave and have the right to leave confederation if russia annexes ukraine but gives ukrainians equal citizenship no one will say ukrainians still have self determination as a minority in russia that would be ridiculous it s something putin would argue the jewish right to self determination is not infringed in the scenario where for instance a single state with equal rights for all its citizens occupies the space between the jordan river and the mediterranean even if jews would then no longer be a majority of that state previously you mentioned in regard to the united states that happened a long time ago implication being what is done is done international law and

identity trumped any sense of civic patriotism self determination means the ability for self defense and to protect one s own interest that s why we have nation states when you don t have it in the middle east you get druze and yazidis and assyrians being massacred mercilessly the basic law of palestine its proto constitution defines palestine as arab with islam as its official religion hamas

people they hate gay people they hate everything about the western world this includes you people see blatant propaganda on twitter and on here and just believe it no matter how ridiculous it is if someone told you that jews were bbqing arab babies and eating them i bet you would believe them because it s the in thing to do there looks like there are so many people supporting palestine because there are over billion mulsims and they support each other no matter what even if they are blatant terrorists they still support one another and that no muslim can do any wrong just watch this video and see the mindset of your average palestinian they hate jews more than they love their own children they will never be able to live peacefully because they are nothing but hate they would rather watch their own children die than to work with israel', 'to all the people who justify the activities of hamas i have a few questions are you angry at the european countries that invaded north america and massacred masses of natives are you angry with them for invading and abusing countries in eastern australia and africa and hiring people as slaves are you angry with china or russia for occupying territories why not and i will tell you two things other countries in the world did this for money resources and power while the jews sought refuge for them the search for a state was survival because they were massacred and persecuted in exile you are also not angry because everything is a thing of the past the world strives for progress and enlightenment and so do all the countries i mentioned and so should we all in addition i must mention a significant historical accuracy that distinguishes between the cases there was no occupation here the country was in the hands of the ottomans then in the hands of the british mandate the british government offered the two nations to establish a state here half and half and only the jews agreed to the division there was no occupation before the state of israel was established there were both jews and arabs in israel check me out and i agree with the fact that the country should be democratic and respond to both peoples or it should be divided and the two peoples will live side by side with respect but please i m begging you as you determine what was here and what wasn t check find your information in a reliable place please misinformation spreads on the internet like wildfire and it is important to verify it before we spread it ourselves and hurt people i am in favor of the people in gaza being well and that the money and aid that other countries and the israeli states transfer to them will reach the citizens but unfortunately hamas controls them and takes their money to carry out terrorism terrorism at the expense of their own citizens think what gaza could be so much money and help they could be the next startup nation develop and promote the citizens hamas leaves the citizens with nothing and in israel they try to help we i the taxpayers in israel pay them water and electricity we bought them corona vaccines and helped treat the sick israel wants gaza to develop and we will live side by side in peace that s what i want please really check come here and see that everything i write is correct and please please don t justify the murder of innocent people in israel they don t just bomb innocent people check me really check israel only harms hamas which deliberately builds its headquarters in private buildings why israel always sends a warning knock on the door so that the citizens know to flee before they damage hamas positions check me out in this operation there were several attacks in which israel did not warn so that members of hamas would not run away either and almost they issued a warning to many residents in gaza to evacuate before an attack because they do not want to harm them did hamas do this did he aim his many rockets at a specific location or shoot babies elderly people and animals from point blank range and if you so much want israel to belong entirely to the palestinians what do you propose to do with us after all we were born here to this life to this country what should we do will we be deported to another country and go through a holocaust again where shall we go don t forget most of us are just ordinary people for example i am a student i don t consider myself a jew at all but an atheist for that matter my dream is to save the planet and travel the world my energies are more or less invested in this do i deserve to die i deserve to die because you think my ancestors did something wrong i only hope for peace and love between all people in the world and i wish for everyone to have great ambitions for themselves which do not include hurting others and they will succeed in them', 'this comment is written with a lot of self confidence but unfortunately it gets the entire conflict wrong in two fundamental ways that make your conclusion completely nonsensical the occupation is not the reason for palestinians to become militants and fighting israel in a manner which often involves committing war crimes of their own the people we now call palestinians have been massacring raping looting and dismembering the people we now call israelis while chanting palestine is our land the jews are our dogs well before any occupation settlements nakba the existence of israel in general or any comparable violence by the jews against arabs the stated reason for the genocidal oct th style violence then was precisely the same one as now and in every point in between the opposition to the idea of a jewish state on rightfully conquered arab muslim land along with a conspiracy theory of the jews wanting to destroy the al aqsa mosque the occupation if even mentioned by modern day palestinian terrorists today always with no exception to the entirety of israel not just the west bank and gaza with every single israeli village town and city being a settlement and every israeli jew being a settler and deserving of death the same goes for every single one of israel s enemies past and present with the possible exception of the now marginal vaguely fatah connected al aqsa martyr s brigade beyond that israel has exclusively fought against enemies that fundamentally didn t believe it should exist the moment any of israel s enemies abandoned the idea of eliminating israel from the river to the sea they miraculously stopped their overt violence against israel violent opposition israel s existence aka zionism and not the occupation or any israeli policy is very clearly provenly the core of this conflict the palestinians have never been willing to make substantial concessions with mean old israel always demanding more it s not just ignorant it s literally an inversion of reality israel has been the one offering substantial concessions and have offered multiple proposals the palestinians didn t accept a single one of those proposals they either rejected them outright or delayed until they were no longer relevant they didn t offer any proposals in return they could never even to concede on the fundamental point of the so called right of return of demanding that half of the palestinian population of palestine immigrates to israel along with two million jordanian citizens in order to make it into a second palestinian state and after refusing to accept those proposals they started a murderous wave of violence the second intifada in order to get more by force and even after they did get more by force a completely unilateral and unconditional israeli withdrawal from gaza they viewed it as a sign of weakness and israel s imminent collapse fired tens of thousands of rockets at israeli cities and elected hamas who promised and delivered a bloody forever war until israel is destroyed and even after that abbas still wouldn t accept the olmert offer delaying until it was no longer relevant and later lying that it was just an unserious napkin offer and still getting flak for even considering it because it would not include the replacement of israel with a palestinian state through the right of return notably while abbas is and was an unpopular figure he got no criticism for not accepting that offer just like arafat didn t get any criticism for rejecting all the previous ones while both got a lot of criticism for daring to accept them and the thing that did enjoy massive almost universal popularity among palestinians at least before they started truly feeling the consequences is the oct th genocide something that was explicitly not done in opposition to the occupation of the west bank or even the occupation of gaza but the occupation of all of israel and the slaughter of the settlers living in israel proper and notably at this point even their western collaborators stopped lying about the intrinsic goal of the palestinian movement and started openly chanting about how it s about opposing the very idea of israel existing zionism and wanting to replace it with a palestinian state from the river to the sea there is no longer any excuse for self delusion on that question with those two points in mind it s clear that your solution of sanctioning israel until it accepts the borders makes no sense as long as the core value of the palestinian movement is the elimination of israel as it has been since to this day sanctioning israel cannot solve the conflict your best case scenario here is to force israelis to agree to temporarily withdraw from the west bank and gaza until the palestinians prepare a far worse version of oct th as they ve promised and i fully believe them and then force the israelis to re conquer it with far more casualties on both sides considering the geographic realities of the matter i understand that you ve been conditioned to view this conflict as inexplicable israeli evil that requires punishing the jewish state into submission but until you recognize the actual inconvenient reality of this conflict and simply listen to what the palestinians and now even their western fellow travellers are saying all you can offer this region is an order of magnitude more bloodshed and suffering so i feel it s very important that anyone with actual skin in the game should ignore everything you propose and say about this conflict as a matter of basic survival']"

question the answer is that this is a different case white european originating americans are not indigenous to the americas and the european colonists never claimed to be indigenous but jews are indigenous to judea nearly all jewish diaspora around the world is a direct result of the actions carried out by the roman empire or by those who previously exiled jews i e babylon and the jews coming to israel now are actually returning after their long time in diaspora there s a good reason they re addressed as diaspora genealogical research and documented history confirm this what about the jews who don t specifically have direct relations with the land the sephardi jews for example it seems unfair to me that any jew living anywhere in the world has more rights to be granted full citizenship of the state rather than someone born there and forced to leave now regarding the don t they deserve the entire land they do but not at the expense of other current residents i openly said in my original reply that the fact jews are indigenous to this land does not mean other populations should be kicked out coexistence is the solution also it s up to native americans to decide what they want to do about their aspirations i agree with that appreciate it you re actually open to talk unlike some others so props to you and this is why i support forming a confederacy rather than two states this is the only solution that guarantees both self governance for palestinians and freedom of movement and relocation for jews pallys across the land to reside where they wish without undermining the jewish right of self determination in their homeland zionism for future use and maintaining the united city of jerusalem as the capital of all of us two states is basically the same as telling jews oh btw you can t live in hebron shchem and shiloh and telling palestinians oh btw you can t live in akko and jaffa despite both having a connection to either place which is textbook immorality while i m personally for a two state solution i get your point jerusalem was actually supposed to international territory since it s holy for all three abrahamic religions a two state solution with accepted borders on both sides is the way to go in my opinion i think there s been a lot of animosity on both sides for them to live as one nation okay so they criticize certain israeli policies and its government there s nothing wrong with that you can criticize israeli policymakers without dragging the blame to all israelis or opposing israel s very existence in fact this only proves that it s possible to criticize our government without being antisemitic thank you for this that s what i ve been trying to tell literally everyone criticizing a state doesn t make you against it s people or the religion criticizing america or saudi arabia doesn t make you anti christian or an islamophobe it s the same for israel unfortunately though the zionists make any criticism to be as anti semitic do you live in israel', 'what defines the essence of being indigenous what elements shape indigenous peoples identity culture and land connection since we ve been discussing the israeli palestinian conflict on the sub i would like to ask your opinions on what it means to be indigenous academically there isn t an agreed upon definition of what it means to be indigenous for some people it s about who was there first for others it s blood quantum additionally it s about those who ve maintained a continued presence in a land and its relationship to it after conducting extensive research on both jews and palestinians i have come to the conclusion that both groups are indigenous to the land in different ways the palestinians are descendants of the original canaanite and levantine peoples many of whom are also descendants of jews jewish christians and samaritans particularly those in nablus over the years palestinians experienced significant cultural shifts due to being under the rule of the rashidun caliphate which was led by the companions of the prophet muhammad abu bakr umar ibn al khattab khalid ibn al walid and abu ubaidah ibn al jarrah over time the palestinians in the region gradually moved away from speaking aramaic and greek instead adopting arabic as their primary language alongside this shift there was a gradual conversion to islam for those who chose not to convert paying the jizya tax was required to support the various needs of the caliphate while modern day jews are an ethnoreligious group that can trace their origins to judea palestine who would migrate out of the region as a result of the various militaristic conflicts that were present at the time most notably the roman empire these jewish migrants would later travel across europe north africa and the middle east and would intermarry with the local women who would convert to judaism from the populations they migrated to and thus creating the various sub ethnicities within the jewish ethnoreligious framework ashkenazim sephardim mizrahim despite the fact that the vast majority of jews have lived outside the region for years they have maintained a connection to their ancestral roots this has been achieved by preserving their religion using hebrew and aramaic for religious purposes marrying exclusively within the jewish community to uphold their identity and most notably by reciting the phrase l shana haba ah b yerushalayim next year in jerusalem at the end of every passover seder which expresses their hope to return to the holy land what are your thoughts what does it mean to be indigenous from your perspective', 'what if i m jewish and convert to islam am i still jewish if so am i still allowed my birthright trip in this secular state can i still become a citizen without any additional hassle in this secular state if i come into your house and tell you my ancestors lived there years ago would you graciously give it to me if you say no and i take by force would you accept it without fighting back indigeneity is a fluid and multifaceted concept the claim that jewish people are exclusively indigenous to palestine eretz israel because their ancestors were displaced from the land thousands of years ago neglects the shared heritage and diverse descent of many other groups over billion people worldwide have spiritual and cultural descent from the ancient israelites through abrahamic faiths like christianity islam and bah i indigeneity involves more than just being the first people to inhabit a land it encompasses factors such as land stewardship continuous habitation cultural distinctiveness and recent dispossession by settler colonialism palestinians and other groups have continuously inhabited and stewarded the land for centuries maintaining distinct cultural practices and identities connected to ancient peoples of the region when europeans colonized the lands of the iroquois confederacy and algonquian tribes all native inhabitants became designated as indigenous despite their own internal conflicts over land and resources similarly liberia s establishment by african american settlers illustrates that having ancestral ties to a region does not automatically confer indigeneity these settlers were not indigenous to liberia despite their ancestry heritage and current indigeneity are distinct concepts while cultural and spiritual affinity with a group s ancient past is significant the moral political and legal status of being indigenous to a region is tied to recent and ongoing historical contexts of displacement and dispossession not distant ancient history zionism is not some land back movement that seeks to return land and sovereignty to indigenous peoples preserve traditions and abolish colonial systems zionism historically involved taking land away from indigenous and historic communities in palestine zionist land purchases often displaced palestinian peasants through a system of labor apartheid and intentionally targeted land held by absentee landlords rather than local palestinians who sold only of the land these purchases were strategically aimed at creating a new state undermining the right to self determination for palestinians and were supported by british colonial powers against the wishes of native locals']"

true this article touches on the topic and there are links included to other articles which expand on it essentially the calculation is wrong because it assumes all property not owned by jews was owned by arabs no you are mistaken here and the camera article doesn t actually touch specifically on the number the camera article speaks in generalities and doesn t get into land taken from arab citizens of israel nothing here addresses the specificities of land taken from israeli arabs the camera article talks about how confiscating property from absentees outside of israel but these people aren t outside israel these people aren t absent anymore which is why israel calls them present absentees the number is hillel cohen s and alexandre kedar s estimate of out of all the property arab citizens of israel owned before how much has israel confiscated and the answer is according to them source hillel cohen present absentees the palestinian refugees in israel since at yiftachel and kedar if you can point to what specifically in the camera article you linked talk about land stolen from arab citizens of israel please point to it otherwise i ll safely assume that camera doesn t know what it is talking about', 'absentee landlord property law this law classifies those who were expelled fled or left after november as absentees enabling the state to control their property this law is from the ottoman empire it wasn t passed by israel they chose to keep it and yes if someone attacked your country and then fled you wouldn t want him back law of return this law allows every jewish person to immigrate to israel and become a citizen but it imposes restrictive conditions on the rights of palestinians and others to enter stay or become citizens alot of country s have easier paths to return for some ethnic groups italy germany ireland france poland portugal and spain to name a few world zionist organization and jewish agency s role these organizations operate as quasi governmental entities promoting zionist goals often to the detriment of minorities and that s a problem cause israel also has a sharia court as a quasi govemrnetal entity land acquisition law this transferred land from arab towns and villages to the state primarily for jewish use almost all land in israel is state owned and that s how it s like in most countries in the world jewish national fund s role the jnf was given governmental authority to purchase land for jewish use only with financial advantages from the state still not a problem it s a fund if arabs wanted they could have a similar entity law prohibiting land transfer this law stipulates that lands under the control of the state the jewish national fund and the development authority cannot be transferred law prohibiting land transfer this law stipulates that lands under the control of the state the jewish national fund and the development authority cannot be transferred and that s not realy a probelme seeing how most land owned by the jnf and development auturity are neutral reserves cultural and educational institutions law this law mandates support for institutions that promote jewish culture and education often at the expense of minority cultures so i guess all of europe and the middle east are aparhtiad cause they have mandated support for christianity and islam or is it only problematic when jews do it knesset session opening law requires opening sessions with readings from the declaration of independence emphasizing the jewish connection to the state and again how it s different then the us ireland and most other countries political party law bans any political party that denies israel as a jewish state there is no such law seeing how to muslim brotherhood and balad are in the knesset separate educational systems law establishes separate unequally administered educational systems that law was demended by arabs so they could teach more arab values then jewish values local jewish community admission law empowers local jewish communities to exclude applicants based on ethnicity or religion actually it s kind of the opposite arabs have more rights then jews in alot of fields easier accptence into universities not having to be mandatory drafted into the army lighter tax easier building restrictions etc boycott law prohibits calling for a boycott of israel or its institutions impacting palestinians who support the bds movement show me what sane country would allow the biycut of it s self also bds has ties to hamas and fatah', 'you are saying this like israel never compromised territory for the palestinians what about the detachement from gaza strip in for one example not even all the israelis that were evicted got compensation for their homes at this point it looks like israel is ethnically cleansing themselves xd what does gaza have to do with israeli citizens you are missing the point which is the discriminatory system as it comes to property rights jewish israelis can actually get their properties back arab israelis can not get their properties back that is discrimination to be honest i dont know much about the sheikh jarrah incident but i heared that it was against only families that didnt pay their rent correct me if im wrong are there no arabs living in sheikh jarrah anymore the properties were held by the jordanian custodian of enemy property and jordan decided to build homes for palestinian refugees there israel did similar on refugee property under its custodian of absentee property so far so good you can t just leave land empty now israel reconquered jerusalem and have started returning properties that the jordanian custodian had taken to their original jewish owners however the issue is for israeli arab citizens some of them were also classified as absent but are actually still present so present absentees they can not get their properties back which israel refuses which leads to the effect of ethnic discrimination in terms of property rights in israel again i dont know so ill assume you are right and there were no attacks from there at all even then the same people that returned is now living in israel with their ethnicity so even if we are judging these actions as ethnical cleansing the responses to these actions were the contradiction of ethnical cleansing so either there was another justifiable reason for the incident or it was unjustifiable but still not in the aim of ethnical cleansing the aim was to take the land from israeli arabs i ve said this repeatedly it was because of their ethnicity that their land was taken you are the one inferring ethnic cleansing from that again i already answered to that compensations were made and these people are living inside israel the idf was unjust in that incident and for that the other conuntry bodies compensated even if there was compensation there is still discrimination massively so they don t want compensation they want their village back as they were promised by the israeli supreme court there are thousands of more examples iqrit is just the most famous one why should jewish israelis be able to reclaim their properties but arab israelis can not again as stated before whatever the reason is ethnical cleansing isnt relevant and saying it was the reason contradicts the compensations made for that incident and contradicts how israel is nowadays although maybe you only say that there was ethnical cleansing in the past so either way im answering to both read what i actually wrote i didn t say it was ethnic cleansing what i did say was that their properties were taken because of their ethnicity and they are being refused to get their properties back because of their ethnicity if you deem a whole ethnic group of people as a threat then you are still taking land from individuals because of ethnicity ok again i answered to all of that before so i wont answer here again yes you keep saying because they can get compensation it is all fine and dandy i am pointing out that even with compensation there s ethnic discrimination here not sure why you keep trying to minimize it in the us property rights are not different for jews vs arabs vs asians vs etc it is all the same but in israel it isn t im willing to agree israel had made unjust desicions but overall israel has improved over the years considering the low starting point yes and has critisized and compensated well for the incidents that happened no for example the iqrit villagers don t have their land back on the iqrit lands there s currently a few jewish agricultural communities if arabs can be kicked out of their sheikh jarrah homes to return properties to jewish owners why can t jewish israelis be kicked out of their lands to return the iqrit lands israel was under incredible pressure and with that also in mind relatively i think israel has functioned in an amazing manner for jewish israelis yes arab israelis lived under a year military regime with no political rights and had of their land taken from them that s not an amazing manner return the land to the israeli arabs and you might have a point with that there are so many compromises israel has made and offered that claiming there is ethnical cleansing is completely ridiculous especially as years progressed again the focus here is israeli citizens and how they were mistreated because of their ethnicity they should just be given equal rights compromise or not i wont even mention here how unjust and hypocritical the palestinian leadership is because i assume we atleast somewhat agree on that and we are here to criticize israel and how they treated the arabs in israel yes the point of this post was the oppressive military regime and mass property confiscation israel put a portion of its citizens under because of their ethnicity']"

it s exactly as you say most people can t hold multiple truths in their mind as doing so prevents things looking black and white humans are still animals with tribal instincts and our instincts cause us to need things to be black and white and other anyone not part of our tribe nuance is bad for survival we must pick a side tribe you see this tendency with so many things vegan vs omni left wing vs right wing evs vs ice cars cyclists vs drivers israel vs iran israel vs hamas america vs china heck even russia vs ukraine has shades of grey

family guy thought they were making a really edgy joke with the colour gradient where white was normal and brown was terrorists but they were actually just describing how the west treats people it fucking disgusts me that anyone is talking about this as anything but a wanton slaughter of people just unbelievable brutality and violence against an already brutalised population

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-12 11:42:07+00:00 --- ---
dude that was like fear waves ago turns out it is a non issue and that some people were fear mongering because they disliked brown people who knew if you re going to be prejudiced at least be fashionable in it

i am sorry you feel this way i am not racist at all don t infer things from these comments i am just being accurate with terms without that we cannot have an honest discussion you always support the government that is funny i support them so much i am pretty sure i am already on some lists and not the good kind once again you don t really know me and if you would tell people that do know me what your views are on me they wold be sure you have mistaken me for someone else i guess it s the nature of messaging on social media that creates these situations

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-07 10:48:55+00:00 --- ---

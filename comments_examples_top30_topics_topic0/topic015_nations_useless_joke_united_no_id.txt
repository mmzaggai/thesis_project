this is all an assumption from the start you already said i suspect the un figures so your entire claim is already dependent on something being true without any proof of it

realistically the un cannot do much on a diplomatic level a lot has been done but when your opponent is the world s only superpower and a rogue state with nukes there isn t much that anyone has the ability to do it s a bully situation if the bully is stronger than you you can only go to higher authorities to resolve the situation what higher authority exists in this world that can counter the most powerful military in history

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-20 18:53:02+00:00 ---

un is great at performative gestures but when it comes to stopping a genocide or holding members accountable to their war crimes crickets

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-16 12:17:52+00:00 ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-22 22:53:49+00:00 ---

as an american i applaud this the united states should cut off all funding to the un for everything except the security council hopefully after the election we can make it happen

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-20 11:04:40+00:00 ---
beautifully written but out of context lets answer one simple question here first who does the un represent how many countries are there in the world what does the un security council do how many are permanent and how many are rotating why am i asking you these questions its simple see you need to understand the west doesn t represent the world the west are that is driving the world doesn t make them right always each time there is a resolution we have a vote each of those resolutions u mentioned all countries had voted the members council had voted not necessarily they won that is a different thing amongst many resolutions the permanent members vetoed the decision anyway throughout the history of the un there were s of these resolutions s got shelved s were removed and rejected but within all the midst u have to see which countries voted for it and which voted against it it might not matter to u as an individual because u are only looking at the final outcome but it does matter to the world leaders to understand how they stand on an issue if you are a power like the us u can do what u want like any country on earth but without the backing of ur own allies u are all alone selfish and egocentric might not stop it but slowly and steadily the world politics changes on the very basis of ur actions good example the uk and french suez canal war small country like israel current government doing all this is only because the us is allowing it last un resolution although seem useless and ignored shows exactly how alone they are in this what happens if the american people decide that no longer their taxpayers money goes to israel how will it sustain itself where is the money the economy who will buy from them do u know of their economy is based on exports and from that almost all of it is to the us the people are not the problem the economics is see palestinian people are now a burden they are scarred the economy is doomed unemployment is super high these refugees are extremely expensive to sustain and cross border trade is not gonna happen with the arab neighbors how will it sustain itself by selling olives

it is not some people it is the international community of nations in the form of the un the icj as well

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-11-15 02:01:21+00:00 ---
unfortunately the general assembly has no power they need to dissolve the security council or atleast the p for any kind of progress to be made in enforcing international law

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-14 02:08:25+00:00 ---
i don t blame them for not wanting to get into a shootout but i do blame them for not reporting the tunnels to the un or if they did for the un covering it up the un is pretty useless useless as t on a bulls let s say if they functioned like the un should then wouldn t have happened nopalestinian non combatants would have died and this war wouldn t be expanding logical conclusion this is the un s fault and they should be treated like the incompetent organization that it is

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-15 18:59:51+00:00 ---

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-22 15:45:11+00:00 ---
that feels like maybe a really bad lie to participate in spreading the un is an organ of empire why would the american death machine sign on to an assault on itself

on the contrary to me it shows that the un warning was right all along just like everyone who said from the start that the goal was ethnic cleansing and annexation

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-20 11:16:23+00:00 ---

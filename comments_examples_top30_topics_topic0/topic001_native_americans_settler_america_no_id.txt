yes most places that colonize negotiate small settlements like canada or more accurately the british empire before canada succeeded and the united states did with the indigenous i think you should have taken the deal because now there is no deal did canada and the us say whoops you re right guys here s your land back sorry for conquering you no they didn t

the people who were displaced were displaced because they tried to murder their neighbors when you try to murder your neighbors and fail your neighbors are typically going to insist that you leave most people see that as reasonable

just take over no this thing you are talking about did happen the states all got together and agreed on where to put an indian reservation some whites were already living there those whites had to move from say oklahoma to texas but according to you the indians just suddenly took over and you believe now whites should be able to say hey we don t want an all indian land here and that it is obtuse to say there are other states where whites would be just fine living so racist of you to justify the dissolution of the indian reservations

dutch pilgrims as far as i m aware there were no dutch pilgrims to america and they certainly could not have predated english colonists by years as that d put them around three generations before columbus s voyage the first dutch settlers in the us were from the dutch east india company they were acting on behalf of the dutch government and they predated the plymouth company s first settlement by five years in the establishment of fort nassau in albany in the pilgrims were english puritans who moved to leiden holland to escape persecution in england and then received a charter from the plymouth company to settle in new england the mayflower people i think that might be why you re confusing them with the dutch colonists along the hudson river

i think that the whole problem with this conversation is the laughable attempt to promote the concept of indigenous in what is nominally a region that is part of the center of civilization it s nothing like aboriginal people s or native americans this land belongs to whoever owns it it s been that way for about as long as we ve been recording history only when there are indigenous people is it ok to call the people that brought trade and massive amounts of technology and agriculture to those people colonizers the problem is trying to name a group indigenous

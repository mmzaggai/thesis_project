you certainly believe a lot of disproven idf propaganda

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-27 06:19:03+00:00 --- ---
civilians have been treated as hamas by the idf that s what happening

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-27 13:11:57+00:00 --- ---
so you re saying idf is bombing a lot of empty places just for the sake of destroying them

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-20 22:40:24+00:00 --- ---
ok can we get your solid proof that idf soldiers strangled a yo of that they threw grenades after grenades in a shelter full of civilians or that they mass raped women then executed them or that they slowly burned tied up families alive

idf is the most cowardice military in the world they remind me of the time moses came back from sinai with commands and they were doing pagan rituals around the ox

well on oct they launched a barrage of but accd to idf they ve slowed down to about per day these are idf numbers so take with a grain of salt ofc

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-22 15:05:11+00:00 --- ---
but wouldn t that be all the more reason why we d be seeing evidence for the idf genocide

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-02 21:06:46+00:00 --- ---
unfortunately not it seems like many idf soldiers who make brutal mistakes e g shooting hostages holding a white flag those who are genuinely malicious and certain wb settlers who are violent do not face the repercussions they should certainly this is something i want israel to improve on maybe i m not informed on when and how the idf handles these situations but i rarely see it in the media i believe a drastic change in israeli government would help improve this issue

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-15 22:52:38+00:00 --- ---
so anyone in a photo with netanyahu or any idf solider is a valid target then

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-11-16 16:20:00+00:00 --- ---
how does one recognize an idf tourist

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-01 18:07:45+00:00 --- ---
yeah idf only screws up never intentional target practice

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-29 08:25:27+00:00 --- ---
so you support the idf

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-25 21:26:13+00:00 --- ---
no i didn t i said that was what you would call it which you did you can t see a person standing on balcony and accuse them of a military purpose idf was monitoring the terrorist for several days before the attack they made their decision based on the facts they collected

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-08 20:18:53+00:00 --- ---
it s good they arrested them but this shouldn t have happened in the first place this entire war has featured a lot of immature and immoral behaviour from some idf soldiers situations like this as well as posting tik toks of them destroying homes and playing in the ruins the world is watching the idf with a magnifying glass looking for any screw up so yeah i think the idf needs to be on top of there solider and way more stringent on what is and isn t acceptable behaviour

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-01 17:54:13+00:00 --- ---
but what does it accomplish chanting death to the idf the guy ends up losing his visa getting dropped from his record label and on top of that people on one side continue cheering while people on the other side move farther away no minds were changed it only increases the division rather than creating sensibility common ground nuanced thought that promotes understanding between people on both sides of the coin it s not productive it doesn t accomplish anything if anyone wants people to hear their message of human activism it s probably best to drop death from the slogan

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-30 01:20:40+00:00 --- ---
idf sm team is busy repeating the same old rhetoric and trying to justify a genocide but also claiming to be the victim you can t make it up if you tried it s mind boggling

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-07 22:27:51+00:00 --- ---
not exclusively if you think a socialist is going to view an idf soldier enforcing a checkpoint on a family in the west bank as equals because they are both working class then i don t know what to tell you

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-30 19:15:14+00:00 --- ---
they are also the only democracy and nuclear power in the middle east they are truely one of our greatest allies i had the privilege to train with the idf during an international training evolution while i was in the us marines they were top notch and held their own with us marines royal marines adf royal australian regiment and rok marines during the exercises one of the most professional militaries in the world imo

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-07 11:38:03+00:00 --- ---
the question is whose fault i don t even think it s fair to blame the idf for every death it s a war zone and it was known that the idf was present in the area emergency services have ways to coordinate with the idf but apparently they didn t just because it looks like an ambulance that doesn t mean that it is not a threat sadly enough the famous video itself provides some evidence that the idfs reaction was justified if you don t cut out the extended firefight at the end

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-12 05:29:41+00:00 --- ---
idf is a terrorist organisation

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-03 16:37:48+00:00 --- ---
the first thing you mentioned was claimed to be an accident the second thing you mentioned is a buzzwords sentence either good or bad the idf is at halt for the last two months also it has nothing to do with genocide

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-20 22:30:23+00:00 --- ---
also everyone seems to forget the objective of the idf they re not bombing for the hell of it they re not doing it because they enjoy the global condemnation and being called murderers they have a very specific and critical military objective they have to destroy miles of subterranean tunnels and the only way to do it is to collapse the ground above them you can blame hamas for that

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-18 19:53:37+00:00 --- ---
weird that after almost years the idf has only killed of civilians considering the narrative you re suggesting

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-15 16:44:08+00:00 --- ---
i m pretty sure they re on video shooting at idf from inside the hospital and all after yesterday s incident so it looks like the game is over for them not that there was ever any reason to believe them

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-07 00:10:12+00:00 --- ---
doesn t the idf control that area

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-06 17:10:54+00:00 --- ---
it also not gong to stop you don t stop the culture of an organization overnight and i don t think in this case at all the idf will be their own worst enemy and by the end of it will be seen as equivalent possibly worse than hamas it won t be anyone s fault but their own they have the rope to hang themselves and they are doing it with a middle finger outstretched i wish innocent people didn t have to die and yes everyone will see what you re doing they kind of already do and the horror gets worse daily globally i d personally be shocked is there is a jewish ethnostate at the end of this

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-09 23:37:23+00:00 --- ---
the chief of staff came out and said the hd is not an idf policy this was in it never was an official policy to begin with i find it hard to believe i missed this announcement you are talking about

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-27 17:10:00+00:00 --- ---
ugh this is extremely disappointing and terrible force protection is vital but the actions described are at odds with our values and we expect better from the idf i am personally confident that these incidents are not the result of commanders and soldiers just wanting to kill there must be prosecutions and given the investigations described in the article and already in progress i expect there will be accountability will not undo the damage but does differentiate us from the other side which never does anything of the sort i am grateful for the free press and israel s democratic culture where people feel obliged and free to speak out this simply does not exist elsewhere in the middle east and no this is still not genocide not even close so critics should not go there but they surely will

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-14 16:55:06+00:00 --- ---
while i have you what are your thoughts about the credibility of the idf on accusations of war crimes and misconduct against it i read that of over complaints made about the idf only resulted in an indictment do you think the idf is trustworthy and honest

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 20:59:47+00:00 --- ---
of course they don t admit to it no army admits to war crimes but they do admit to shooting warning shots and people keep dying and people keep saying the idf is doing it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-13 15:36:18+00:00 --- ---
do you believe that the idf should model its behavior based on what hamas would arguably do

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-28 19:58:28+00:00 --- ---
i wouldn t lie i heard racist claims about arab practitioners but i ve never experienced anything that would make me believe there s anything to justify the claims more than that they take care of idf soldiers all the time since arab physicians cover most of the weekend shifts in ers and emergency clinics and soldiers have time to get medical attention mostly during the weekends

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-20 15:21:48+00:00 --- ---
a large archive of the abuse idf dishes out to the palastinans straight from ex idf soldiers this is something i just picked up

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-12 19:36:24+00:00 --- ---
hamas surrenders idf is doing the killing of innocents idf are the terrorists

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-21 13:45:15+00:00 --- ---
that is the idf if we believe your version is deliberately shooting at civilians and this is terrible hamas according to your admission is doing the same but for a good purpose so you have no complaints against them and you are even ready to defend them despite the fact that they have managed to kill more palestinians than the idf in its entire history did i understand correctly

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-17 20:42:53+00:00 --- ---
rockets from groups like islamic jihad can hardly do so much damage not the first time idf has been caught lying probably a idf pilot went berserk these things tend to happen when you play the victim

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-26 12:26:29+00:00 --- ---
show me the evidence remember idf constantly lies and never provide evidence for their claims but if you have some i d like to see it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-30 11:46:45+00:00 --- ---
i don t need to volunteer we are all part of the idf in reserve that s why i know and you think

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-12 02:49:05+00:00 --- ---
never said i m but if you re really young like i know you are and if your parents had you young i could still be old enough to be your grandfather sure there s a maximum age limit for the idf reserves but why would you know that

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-21 20:27:57+00:00 --- ---
its not explaining is justifying even justifying taking pictures with the intimate clothes of the dead so yeah dont come here with the killing them before they kill you bullshit idf isnt really that much better than their enemies

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-23 00:41:07+00:00 --- ---
go down and ask your idf commander bro

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-20 09:08:56+00:00 --- ---
obviously not but as things stand the idf is getting of the blame and being accused of bullshit like genocide while hamas leaders are rolling around in donation money

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-27 13:54:18+00:00 --- ---
israel is a country for those of all backgrounds and the idf will do what s needed to protect israeli citizens

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-29 01:37:06+00:00 --- ---
look into it i remember the story riot with firebombs idf operates to meters from aid stations

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-26 02:44:53+00:00 --- ---
its honestly one of the only good options for a lot of folks in poverty and especially young men in or affiliated with gangs not a lot of difference between the marines and a street gang except the violence is legal so they scoop up kids that are accustomed to violence and are desperately in need of any kind of family or brotherhood to fill the void left by a broken home dangle a hope of a successful life in front of them and manipulate them into killing people to perpetuate the same systems that fucked them in the first place

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-15 18:28:09+00:00 --- ---
you re just brainwashed by idf propaganda

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-20 16:29:55+00:00 --- ---
military censor would u do the same for daesh

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-02 17:34:31+00:00 --- ---
jonathan conricus is also a former spokesperson he s now funded by the fdd which is nothing to scoff at and by my estimation both him and eylon levy are more famous in english speaking circles than they were before they left their posts i get that it sounds silly to introduce them with former but as soon as they start talking you kind of forget about it the only meaningful difference in my mind is the access to information before the idf government acts but going by my understanding of how the government and idf operate even they barely know what they re going to do before they do it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-01 19:38:32+00:00 --- ---
how come you don t have to condemn the idf for the bombing killing mass arresting and the use of chemical weapons in civilian areas

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-26 11:04:36+00:00 --- ---
i m just point out the ppl you re defending don t mind doing messed up things and your government does a good job covering them up for the most part so i provided you with links to show you why ppl don t like the idf and why they are judged in the way they are

evidence shows that at best increasing police activity in gang neighborhoods of american cities does not help at all this is of course irrelevant as gang violence is not comparable to global terrorism which increases in response to counter terrorism which is usually just another word for terrorism not bothering to cite this since you can throw a stone and hit a half a dozen sources

well you should have sympathy for people who by no fault of their own live in a police state they were born into that you were lucky totally by random chance to have been born into a free society western style states are in fact very rare

that is what i was wondering haaretz reported that while one officer fired warning shots in the air the second more junior officer shot al halaq while he was trying to hide behind a dumpster so did they shoot him while he was running away did they find him cowering behind a dumpster and cold blooded execute him either situation is horrendous but the later is way worse edit nm it sounds like he was running to hide behind a dumpster and got shot before he could

one of the first us police forces was established in boston when a bunch of rich landowners decided they didn t want to keep paying private security and spread the cost to the rest of society

yeah i have the problem is that having rules is a privilege a privilege we gain by having an authority to enforce those rules but what happens when the rules are not enforced and the other side doesn t follow them i agree that in a perfect world we d follow the rules even if the other side doesn t but the real world is much more dirty let me give you a small thought experiment to ponder say you live somewhere so rural the police just won t come no matter what say for some reason the only well is on your side of the fence and your neighbor has to draw water from it now say said neighbor tried to stab you would you still let him into your house to drink you d certainly be afraid and might only allow him to take water under armed supervision and what if even under supervision he still managed to stab you what then

some will tell you that there are a lot of good people in the police but every single one of them has taken a job that allows them to hurt members of the public they might seem lovely in any other setting but if the government tells them to hurt you they will do it all police worldwide are just hired goons for their governments

only the police were not defunded instead floyd s killer was convicted and sent to prison thing is without the riots in his killer would likely not have been charged so in that way it was absolutely necessary but wouldn t have been if that policeman was charged from the jump similar issue happened recently in philadelphia where police weren t charged until after some rioting the situation in question saw the police report that the victim got out of the vehicle and charged them when camera footage taken by a good samaritan shows the victim stayed in the vehicle hopefully district attorneys nation wide have gotten this message or it will cause more unfortunate riots

if your neighbor is a gangster and father of kids that gets drunk from time to time and shoots into your bedroom would you call the police or not because if you do when they come for him and he starts shooting at the police the police will shoot back and one of those kids could get hurt especially if he deliberately puts the kids at the windows and shoots from behind them will you be happy if his kid gets shot i doubt it will you prefer that he shoots from time to time i mean usually he doesn t hit anyone anyways why bother the police and risk kids getting shot

not sure about qatar specifically though they do dump quite a lot of money into us educational institutions and are no doubt involved but there s an entire suit about sjp funding and terrorist links all these organizations can be linked to one another via money trails and members in common especially individuals who were prominent parts of the organizations that were convicted for funding hamas in

that s why we need congress to look into it which they are doing albeit slowly qatar is the largest foreign donor to american institutions donating billion from to which wasn t required to be disclosed at the time isgap says that qatar even operates assets worth billion to trillion usd as soft power in the us in addition there s strong evidence of american muslims for palestine which has links to recognized terrorist groups funding njsp and similar groups on campuses there s evidence to suggest that universities that received major funding from arab sources between and saw a rise in anti semitic incidents in that time frame vs those that did not receive funding i am not saying the above has all been conclusively proven but it does need to be investigated which i m thankful is finally happening edit also it s not just money we have evidence that njsp amp and other radical groups are providing training education organizational support ideological guidance networking mobilization and protest tactics across college campuses across the country

now if qatar was blackmailing our politicians that s a completely different story then the us has lost control trump he should be in jail for accepting the bribes from qatar isn t obligated to comply with qatar s wishes unless his greed for more bribes is what obligates him meanwhile the way the israel lobby and israel work is that they ll threaten to run ads against you around the clock instead of against your opponent that have nothing to do with israel which is legal thanks to citizens united and they ll add the carrot too like the adelson s giving over m to support donald trump reportedly to get him to allow israel to annex the west bank like he s allowing russia to annex much of ukraine including crimea and there s probably regular blackmail too

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-06 12:58:30+00:00 ---
when the us negotiators realize that qatar is burning the candle at both ends and will make a fool of the us counter parts things will change trump doesn t like being played and we can take away all of their wealth privileges in a matter of a few days it might be a lesson to the rest of the arab league not to challenge us ever again

you should read about how much money qatar gives to america and you ll find that it is way more alarming than aipac i m a member of aipac all of the money we give to politicians is from american donors not money that israel has given us qatar in the other hand is sending a ton of money to podcasters universities and politicians their money often has come from iran and the muslim brotherhood

very sobering statistics and unfortunately this is the attitude of much of the muslim world but it s changing the uae and morocco and bahrain signed agreements with israel saudi arabia may do so as well hamas leadership sees that the momentum is going against it which is why they attack now in a last ditch effort to save their sorry corrupt bloodthirsty movement as they sit in their luxury apartments in qatar

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-02 17:30:16+00:00 ---
i agree my concern was the tone but in the same breath we can not disregard the influence of zionist organizations on campuses either qatar is late to the party when it comes to shaping the discourse

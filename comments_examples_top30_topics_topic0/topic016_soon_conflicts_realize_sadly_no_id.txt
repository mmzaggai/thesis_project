i didn t say i m for it i said that i feel it s the only solution to this centuries old conflict and it makes me sad to realize that there s a good explanation for that but i m not going to bother telling you in detail because i can already tell your question is not in good faith

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-02 22:47:10+00:00 ---
i don t have a solution my current focus in this debate has been what i said to shift people s motivation from identifying blame to identifying more solutions even if i had a solution no one fucking cares or will do what i say but i have the ability to talk to people who then talk to other people and that s how i believe ideas are spread do you have a solution do you think that we should just roll with what s happening do you think that this type of conflict won t happen and the future and are you okay with this type of solution again and again in the future i think it s time to invest in finding a solution that makes this situation less horrifying when it happens in the future

not inherently as they come in a lot of different forms and either can be worse than the other but they re different and the knee jerk reaction to go no actually the other side is the one that did bad thing about so much of the i p conflict just leads to a superficial and meaningless attempt to try and justify actions with no real thought or critical analysis

the conflict didn t start on october th

no it might be because this has been happening since any other conflicts have that longevity

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-05 00:33:06+00:00 ---
i was thinking and it seems to me that people care about this conflict so much because it reflects their sense of right and wrong which is just a byproduct of their history and personal experience

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-16 01:26:12+00:00 ---
are you dissembling or do you really have no idea about the basics of this conflict and its actors

if you were you would know why simple truths and catchy slogans can never capture either sides position in the conflict but if you can t read four paragraphs it s pretty obvious you would have barely scratched the surface of a conflict that has filled countless books and academic journals let alone both versions of the regions history which to be frank is one of the worst takes i ve heard about the whole thing in a long while there are simply the factual events of the history there are no two versions there are opinions and there is cherry picking on both sides that attempts to put forward certain things and reject others but the events as they have happened are incredibly well documented and studied from numerous unbiased sources and are immovable there is only the regions history there are no versions this isn t the mcu there is decidedly only one timeline

what role do you believe played in shaping the conflict

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-16 23:38:52+00:00 ---

he s saying people who aren t part of this conflict should stop warmongering

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-04-20 04:42:17+00:00 ---
i do think the true conflict boils down to i have it and i want to keep it versus but i had it and i want it back that could be true and i partially agree with you but there are numerous cases in modern history when a state society nation had territory taken and more or less got over it finland for example but these entities often aren t too put out by it materially but on the other hand i think another reason the conflict gets a lot of attention is that the people involved are mostly smart well educated rational people and it feels as if this should be a very easy conflict to resolve also true the fact that it s considered a close western ally probably doesn t help matters

enjoy constantly intervening in every conflict sounds hard

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-14 02:40:54+00:00 ---

i don t know why this is a controversial or racist take for anyone who has been remotely watching the conflict they have literally openly and proudly admitted to this multiple times for over fifty fears it s not new news you have to be extremely uneducated or too lazy to spend minutes on wikipedia to figure this out

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-01 20:05:47+00:00 ---
yes let s vote for the dusty mf that s offering a blank check to fund this very difficult conflict

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-02 06:23:18+00:00 ---
if do it through like assassinations and crap is your best solution to this conflict then i d suggest next time keep your comments in the section this is real life not a fairytale

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-07 05:07:26+00:00 ---
yeah this conflict has done wonders for crushing my idealistic view of democracy the peoples voice matters for naught if it impedes american interests

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-15 20:43:15+00:00 ---
i honestly believe that on social media during flare ups in the conflict a significant portion of the pot stirring is done by bots like this which contributes to the misalignment with reality

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-18 09:53:52+00:00 ---
i think this is one of the best summaries of the conflict as a whole i ve ever encountered just remove the r and you have the whole situation at large right there

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-20 15:26:19+00:00 ---
noone said my side is right nor am i picking a side in the conflict it s important to however put things into context rather than take a snapshot in time of what happened on october th

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-24 15:37:27+00:00 ---
no because there are still some sane voices in the world who understand it s a nuanced case and don t believe agenda setting social media influencers where do you get your information about the conflict from

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-25 23:07:53+00:00 ---
they re pretty unified on that specific issue

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-27 17:58:33+00:00 ---
i mean the name suggests that it should be a place to collate information of the current conflict clearly it s just a place filled with armchair politicians lol

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-03 22:26:41+00:00 ---
i didnt ask for the phase many people act like the whole conflict started in

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-09-01 19:25:38+00:00 ---
i would agree but if there was ever a time where this was less of a problem it would be in this situation where you are speaking over a conflict that has an almost comical level of disproportionate attention

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-06 15:30:16+00:00 ---
the real illusion is the red vs blue this is exactly what they want the people to be fighting against each other so that they don t come to realize that the real problem is the ones on top it s all an illusion and i m sure many more will come to see this for themselves we have to come together as humans

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-10 20:18:53+00:00 ---
there really isn t any parallel this is an ongoing conflict that has been happening literally for years over land i m wondering if this ever ends will it be due to our finally going spacefaring

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-11 07:09:12+00:00 ---
i am done with you your grasp of the conflict seems to be completely unrealistic

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-16 16:36:46+00:00 ---
both sides in this conflict are a problem

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-10 14:50:17+00:00 ---
seeing comments like this is honestly the saddest part of this whole conflict

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-05 00:37:14+00:00 ---
that will likely make the conflict more deadly for everyone involved

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-29 08:21:38+00:00 ---
beause this is a years of conflict years of trying out a solution this is the only way

sure you can because it s easy the conflict has been going for so long it s almost a sport please don t take this the wrong way there are no teams here and there are no goals to score what s needed is too stop the game and change the rules

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-26 02:39:55+00:00 ---
yes the conflict of course didnt start on oct and there were many university educated who had been brainwashed to believe and feel the need to teach everyone about right and wrong sides of history as if they had the grip on it and that was a case closed topic the hate has only grown as the fashion of online necessitates mocking and dehumanising those you think are evil and enjoying the banter and being part it as if you are a rebellious ground roots hero for the good cause no awareness for the damage thats been done and will take quite a road ahead to correct course gotta get people off their addiction to hate and mockery

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-08 20:54:08+00:00 ---
it s okay to say you don t like both sides in a conflict

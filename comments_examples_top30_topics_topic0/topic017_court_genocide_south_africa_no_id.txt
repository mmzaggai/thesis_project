it was rhetorical but you still haven t answered it and it did address the previous statement you are making the assumption that a genocide is taking place pro genocide so i m asking you if the icj determines a genocide is was not taking place will you accept that you are wrong

this seems arbitrary why were white claims of african conducted genocide not plausible in south africa but zionists claims of a genocide against jews plausible

here are countries that have rejected icj jurisdiction so yeah it s not legal it s political but there is precedent united states withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction russia withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction china never accepted compulsory jurisdiction france withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction india narrowed acceptance excluded many categories turkey rejected jurisdiction in aegean sea case israel rejected icj advisory opinion on west bank barrier south africa withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction during apartheid indonesia never accepted compulsory jurisdiction iran selective challenges especially after withdrew from treaties giving icj jurisdiction

no it took the icj years to rule on the bosnian genocide these cases take years irrespective of the merit of the case

sorry if that was your experience from my comment it wasn t my intention i just disagree with this outrage people have in this thread about media and pro pals talking about the icj deciding that the genocide was plausible being completely wrong and misleading because imo it really isn t even inaccurate

sorry but no the icj is a biased joke whose members vote the interests of the states that appoint them not true the ugandan judge always votes for israel more than even the israeli ad hoc judge even though uganda supports palestine on the other hand you have judges from countries that are strongly pro israel like germany and the us voting for palestine anyone can see the efforts the idf is going through to keep civilian casualties to a minimum this is probably the most challenging urban warfare conflict in history and the statistics support that great precision is being used if israel s objective was to exterminate the palestinians they could have decimated that strip of land on october th this is an often repeated but inaccurate understanding of what constitutes genocide genocide has nothing to do with the number of people you kill you could kill an entire population and not be convicted of genocide and kill only a fraction and be convicted of genocide

ok so let them sit trail at the icj full and frank confession before a court of law should help deal with some of that trauma

the icj has never ruled that it is a plausible genocide joan donoghue who has just retired as president of the international court of justice icj spoke to bbc hardtalk s stephen sackur about the case brought by south africa to the icj over alleged violations of the genocide convention by israel ms donoghue explained that the court decided the palestinians had a plausible right to be protected from genocide and that south africa had the right to present that claim in the court she said that contrary to some reporting the court did not make a ruling on whether the claim of genocide was plausible but it did emphasise in its order that there was a risk of irreparable harm to the palestinian right to be protected from genocide

israel has not been found guilty of apartheid by the icj several countries have seeked a legal opinion from the icj with the secretary general of un driving it and putting one sided documentation israel was asked if it wants to participate but did not why do so and help your enemy prepare an actual law suit against you the icj gave an opinion on very narrow references and indeed some of the icj judges wanted the references to extend to hamas and palestinians if is essentially like you going to a lawyer and saying here is my documentation do i have a case against this person if this goes to icj court israel will have their own documents and evidence

ok im sorry but you genuinely dont know what you are talking about yes it is speculation again its one example of an incident we cant confirm and dont actually know the details of it could have just as well been a mistake which happens that doesnt mean israqel is targeting civilians no that s not how that works edit it s also bad when america and russia do this yes that s literally how that works again you dont know what you are talking a bout and the fact that you said its just as bad when america or russia does it proves you acknowledge thats how it works so why would you start by lying and saying thats not how it works when its obviously how it works like seriously are you just being disingenuous yes the un judged the serbs for failing to prevent or punish genocide punish being the key word there and held its leaders responsible again selective enforcement and they had to first get those leaders in custody which they generally dont bother with but the case was brought to the icj because they failed to punish those responsible on a national level meaning they were supposed to prosecute them internally and this is one of very few cases where the icj bothered holding someone accountable which rarely happens because they have little actual authority unless actual states take the matter into their own hands and even then its selective unjust enforcement i didn t say its the lowest i said its among the lowest syria absolutely wasn t to over k casualties and their documentation is worse than gaza and you cant combine a rate russia ukraine is a very unique war and over million ukrainians were allowed to flee the war zones and you arent factoring in the conditions also thats a guardian article taking the isreali report out of context ill wait for more accurate accounting but it s irrelevant because still far less non combatants have died in this war than in the majority of other wars in the highest population density of any warzone with km of terror tunnels the non combatants sit above in a place the un not israel but the un refuses to allow refugees to flee again israelis casualty rate is a positive its amazing actually its shocking there arent k dead in those conditions they are doing an amazing job of minimizing casualties how can you have a higher death rate combined the total in syria and afghanistan was k or more in syria and k or so in afghanistan its not even close to those totals combined or individually and it about matches the non combatant total in ukraine the rate is dependent on the specific circumstances and most real analysis suggests syria was much higher than that but either way and no last year the lancet published a bs theoretical analysis using a theoretical model that suggest up to k gazans could be dead which was used for propaganda there was nothing factual or credible about their data it was a theoretical prediction that wasn t using real world figures and was published strictly for political and ideological reasons i dont care how respected you think they are that has no bearing on the truth or facts try again

for example in may that k babies will die of starvation over the next hours you know as well as i do that wasnt an official prediction but a guy who talked too fast he explained what he meant very quickly which was that k babies were at risk of severe acute malnutrition and needed food in the next h also he wasnt even part of the ipc so your only example of false statement by the ipc is a disingenuous framing of a statement by someone not part of the ipc

i never rejected the rule of law or said laws are useless i said the icj is a useless political tool corrupt entities cannot carry out the rules of law properly and it s been shown greatly these last few years with both the icj and the un

indeed i hope the icj will conduct a fair and proper trial

the icj does not have the mandate to stop the war mainly since us still holds the veto power and will oppose such decision the case is still pending and we have not seen the end of it so your argument of the war being justified just because it hasnt been stopped by the icj is plainly stupid their task wasnt to contemplate whether its justified or not it was to see if israel is commiting a genocide which they in part deem plausible and legally oblige israel to change their ways as they are creating a humanitarian catastrophy and violating laws in the geneve convention but hey its easier to just create your own derranged narrative right

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-29 22:54:43+00:00 ---
you didn t answer the question was your mind just completely empty on the topic before the icj ruling did you need them to tell you what you should believe or did you ever think about it on your own

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-23 16:09:41+00:00 ---
the very fact that the conversation needs to be had that the icj has to review evidence of genocide that supporters of israel s revenge tour of gaza have to defend themselves against genocide is enough imagine a modern western country even having to defend itself against genocide gross

no historian worth their salt yes i ve seen the case sent by south africa the same government that just hosted hamas even after the th of october massacres you re never going to scratch the surface of understanding this conflict if you are so selective with what to believe anyone with a genocide claim can immediately be written off as biased

wtf do muslims commit genocide that icj approved that it is a genocide but still got the support of g countries who have better pr

are you aware of the refutation what does the icj say about the incitement of violence and genocide against jews

the icj isn t the one attacking israel hamas is so it doesn t matter what the icj believes it matters what hamas believes

i will accept the ruling of the icj when we get one even though i don t have the greatest trust in the way the court operates for and against israel there are many biased parities regardless i agree with you that the way our government runs this war and the occupation is barbaric and totally out of bounds for a substantive democracy

you don t need the icj for accountability

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-26 14:29:21+00:00 ---
the biggest irony here is you re coming across on your high horse about other ppl having trouble reading yet you re making huge jumps from what both the icj and me are saying to what your points are absolutely nothing i said implied that i took the icj ruling as one that there was not genocide me the icj and the op are all very clearly saying this is not a ruling on genocide you are the one who keeps trying to twist it as if i said otherwise and even ended trying to twist it that the icj is closer to saying that there is than otherwise

what value is that it s an inconvenience wide open to political pressure the same country taking israel to the icj for genocide laughed off the icc request to arrest bashir over an actual genocide in the long term none of these pressures matter

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-28 23:30:27+00:00 ---
even the israeli judge on the icj accepted that there was a plausible case of genocide against israel the icj just released another demand a few hours ago stating israel must halt all genocidal acts including bombing civilians civilian and medical infrastructure and withholding food ordering it to open the land crossing for aid trucks today there is no possible justification on earth for blocking trucks containing flour from entering gaza and the only possible motive is mass starvation and death israel also just bombed the surgery wing of al shifa this morning and there are pictures of the whole thing in flames you might not want to believe it but the legal arguments are there in full

the un and the icj are biased against israel as is often argued so it wouldnt change much even if there was an objective legal court that ruled israels actions a genocide people would argue its a justified genocide with the hostages still being held and hamas using gazas as a launch pad for rockets

when the icj ruled the evidence showed a plausible risk of genocide i listened do you have reason to believe an everyday person knows more than the experts on the high court

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-06 22:31:11+00:00 ---
not an expert and i m just reading your comment based on your own comment it seems to me that you are conflating two things a genocide being the only reasonable inference that could be drawn b genocide being the only existing intent that could be inferred these aren t the same a means it is not reasonable to draw any other conclusion other than genocide given the evidence this is referring to alternative explanations that are mutually exclusive with genocide icj claims that if these exist and if they are a reasonable conclusion from the given evidence then this should nullify the genocide claim b means the perptrator having no other intent other than genocide this is referring to intents that are not mutually exclusive with genocide amnesty is claiming that if such intents exist it does not nullify the genocide claim to me this doesn t sound like amnesty is being disingenuous their definition is consistent with icj s

however the absence of genocide charges leveled by the icc prosecutor against netanyahu and gallant which deals with individuals doesn t mean israel is exonerated in the icj case which deals with nations history shows the icc and icj can diverge in bosnia v serbia the icj found serbia failed to prevent genocide at srebrenica while the icty the icc s predecessor convicted some individuals only of war crimes and or crimes against humanity but not genocide so there are examples of different charges at the individual and state level this is not contradictory the reason for the frequent disconnect between icj and icc cases is that genocide has a much higher threshold for intent when applied to individuals at the icc prosecutors must prove that a specific person intended to destroy a protected group in whole or in part this requires a higher burden of proof however at the icj a state may be found to have failed to prevent or punish genocide without proving the state itself had genocidal intent that difference in standards explains why genocide charges are harder to secure against individuals than findings of state responsibility why the icc prosecutor typically charges individuals only for war crimes and crimes against humanity but not genocide while thd icj might rule israel failed to prevent genocide or failed to punish individuals responsible for genocide tldr the absence of charges of genocide against netanyahu and gallant has no bearing on the icj case

ok i ll try my best to be equally helpful and try to break down what mean i m sorry it s long but i really don t know how i can at this point try to summarise it further this is true i m sure there are pro pals that have taken misunderstood the icj preliminary ruling as final proof that it is genocide my experience tho is that it far more common to find pro pals who are worried or are already convinced it is genocide just on the basis of facts and media outside of the icj case and the icj ruling is used as proof that if even the icj thinks it is necessary to entertain and investigate the accusation these fears convictions have a real foundation i e they recognise that icj didn t decide that it is a genocide and i think all anglophone mainstream media has done a good job in making this clear but it shows that is valid to act now against potential genocide it is true that the icj didn t rule per say that the genocide is plausible because it was not one of the things it was making a ruling on in the preliminary decision and this is what the ex judge here is clarifying that it is not under dispute but in this session the court needed to decide whether the palestinians have rights protected by the gc they are a group against which it is possible to commit genocide sa has the the right to protect these rights by bringing the case to the icj those palestinian rights to be protected against genocide are at risk of being irreparably harmed this risk is urgent enough to place legally binding preliminary preventative measures proposed by sa on israel those measures proposed by sa are linked to and the icj has jurisdiction to implement them the whole of the icj january th session s rulings can be summarised to the three main rulings the ex judge in this clip says but actually the court has to make quite a lot of decisions on lot of things to be able to get to those three rulings i didn t list even all of them feel free to read the case summary on all those five points i listed it is fair to say that icj ruled or maybe found is less confusing that they are plausible because icj decided to entertain them and move forward with the case if it wasn t plausible that the palestinian right not to experience genocide wasn t being breeched i e in common speak the genocide is plausible the court would have found and to be plausible but not the rest and thrown out the case the one exception to all of them plausible being that icj rejected sa s proposed measure of ordering a ceasefire because the court found it wasn t plausibly within it s jurisdiction under the genocide convention genocide isn t plausibly the inevitable result of the war hence it s not the courts business to order one way or another about the war i mean even every legal expert analysis trying to explain what happened in the icj session uses the short hand icj found that the genocide accusation is plausible e g because that is what is it means in the larger framework of what the whole icj genocide convention preliminary structure is about it didn t make a ruling that the genocide is plausible as the ex judge says but it is completely fair to summarise the situation to laymen as icj finds that the accusation of genocide is plausible valid enough that the court needs to investigate and take the case into its full investigation i m not dismissing the video per se i m dismissing the way this video is being circulated and received in the pro israeli circles my original comment wasn t about dismissing what the judge says it was about what the op said while posting it s a clip taken out of the larger context of the interview and it is now used as some proof that when absolutely all respectable mainstream media none of whom all this time somehow had access to international law experts to interpret the case for them and their audiences that the ex judge s statements here is something new and completely contradictory all pro pals summarising the icj findings were just completely in the wrong when talking about plausibility of genocide

well the icj opinion is an opinion that isn t based on the reality in the ground also you support crimes against humanity so it s pretty stupid of you to use icj opinions

well it s not a competition you misrepresented the findings of the icj and said they proved it was genocide when they specifically said there was no evidence of genocide so you win i m not even in the game with you

the icj and un are far from perfect but i don t understand the goal of this tribalistic approach where it seems like rather than investing time in understanding what is going on and pursuing the truth from both sides it becomes a scramble to defend our side no matter what regardless of who you support at the end of the day it s sad to see people clinging on to such approaches in such complex and uncertain times

btw i never implied that icj proved genocide it was hard to watch the icj proceedings because they were not present on most american news channels but the johnny depp v amber heard trial was live on any station read between the lines buddy in all seriousness try being unbiased and act as a juror and watch the icj hearings it s disgusting

i am not seeing the connection between bombing south africa and genocide like why south africa is not suing all countries conducting bombing campaigns which affect civillians why does being sued by south africa automatically mean south africa is correct and will win people sue each other all the time there are no statements from icj confirming genocide check again there s no arrest warrant either now you answer me honestly are you anti semitic

nobody in the icj believes south africa is a utopia keep up with the hyperbole to justify a genocide though

i see the line of thought if the icj orders a ceasefire on the merit of these lesser allegations then it stands to reason that it would on the merit on the much worst allegation of genocide but that s not how the icj operates the key word is merit in and the court reached a conclusion on the merits of the allegations themselves i e whether the u s uganda were in fact guilty of the complained of crimes having found that they were the court ordered them to stop doing what they were doing which makes sense genocide allegations follow a different procedural trajectory as you may know first the court has to decide whether it s at least plausible that the defendant israel is committing genocide if the answer is yes they order provisional measures to preserve the rights of the party at risk of suffering genocide here palestinians in gaza if the answer is no they order no such measures here they found the genocide allegation at least plausible and ordered provisional measures accordingly the bottom line is this even if the icj were convinced that israel was committing genocide in gaza they couldn t have concluded as much at this stage because that would have been jumping the gun that simply wasn t the question on the table the question was one of plausibility now there s still a question about why they didn t order a ceasefire as one of the provisional measures none of what s been written that i ve seen suggests that we can draw any inferences about how plausible the court found the genocide allegation from the mere fact that they didn t order a ceasefire for example one consideration is that a ceasefire would have to be binding on both parties but the icj does not have jurisdiction over hamas since hamas is not a party to the genocide convention indeed it s not even a state that s one reason not to order a ceasefire another point that s been made is that the provisional measures which the court did order when considered in aggregate are difficult if not impossible to satisfy without a ceasefire as we ve seen effective provision of humanitarian aid is all but impossible given how this war s being fought to that extent there s an implied ceasefire demand this along with the aforementioned jurisdictional issues may have led the court to conclude that it would have been both unnecessary and inappropriate for them to explicitly demand a ceasefire in short i appreciate your taking the time to discuss these cases it s rare to have evidence based discussions on this forum or indeed anywhere but i just don t think we can draw any conclusions one way or the other about whether the court thinks genocide is really going on all we know is that they answered yes to the question which was on the table at this stage of the proceedings namely whether it s at least plausible that the state of israel is committing genocide against the palestinians in gaza and frankly that alone is something that everyone should take seriously heads of state international lawyers and people of conscience more generally

they denied israels request to throw out the case as they found the evidence plausible you can try to spin it all you like but you re only fooling yourself the icj were very limited in what they could rule on it is just an interin ruling but make no mistake this was damning no state should even get close to the point at which an allegation of genocide becomes plausible

thanks for your response but i m a bit confused you say you believe if the icj rules this a genocide then they re antisemitic but then you say the consequences for their genocide determination should hold israel accountable are you saying that the icj s ruling would inherently be antisemitic but that israel should still follow the icj s recommendations

well i don t know you and have no idea if you are making all of this up sorry i m sorry i dont know what to say you have google chatgpt etc you can easily fact check everything i said international court would make a ruling at some point in time icj said that south africa s case against israel comitting genocide had plausible grounds the un called for a prevention of genocidal acts in gaza but more importantly scholars have been concerned that there s a potential gencoide taking place gaza wont be called a genocide today tomorrow next week it takes years also it takes time to recognize a genocide the holocaust happened from to recognized as a genocide in nurumberg trials bosnian genocide to got recognized in if a bunch judges in the icj is what makes a decision for you then idk what to tell you lol

the international court of justice charged with adjudicating international law literally ruled the war didn t meet the threshold of genocide but no pro palestinian protestors who shout from the river to the sea are more informed and knowledgeable about what constitutes genocide than the actual icj

i don t need to wait for the icj to make a ruling even if they find israel innocent i will still believe it you would not expect a sophisticated country like israel to cause this much destruction there are no more hospitals schools police waterworks bakeries or agriculture life has ceased i don t which wars you are referring to but if they ve inflicted the same amount of damage i m sure there has been genocide too

that s not how charges work you seem confused as i m not talking about if there was a conviction i m saying the prosecutor didn t even issue an arrest warrant against them for genocide after investigating them for genocide for months and having many petitions from rd party orgs to file genocide charges issuing a warrant for arrest is the lowest legal standard in the icc process all you need to show is reasonable grounds to believe the crime could ve occurred you don t even need substantial evidence for substantial grounds until they re arrested and you certify their charges so after investigating for months the prosecutor didn t think he had the evidence to meet the lowest legal standard to issue arrest warrants on genocide charges it s not are they relevant there is no israeli genocide arrest warrants issued by the icc to be relevant in the first place except you didn t bring up the primary institutions of relevance those being the icc and icj just citing to anybody who agrees despite them not having any direct involvement or insight to the case is silly almost all the experts you re talking about also explicitly say they don t actually have access to the information necessary to say if the special intent has been met south africa s memorial their full legal argument is currently confidential so they don t even know what it says but according to the icj it wasn t very convincing as they denied south africa s preliminary requests and no they gave a non legally binding advisory opinion that said illegal settlements in an occupation constitute apartheid in the west bank so they have an obligation to end the occupation none of that agrees with the pro palestinian claims that s just the moderate two stater claim and yes they said don t commit genocide as all nations are already legally obligated to do so that means nothing however when requested to call for an immediate ceasefire or place any new restrictions on israel like south africa asked for they declined they could do it today based on new evidence and have a legal basis too if they thought the evidence was there south africa s request stands they re just continuing to decline it i m also referring to the mainstream palestinian and zionists as both sit on fairly extreme and unpopular positions for this issue the mainstream pro palestinian position i m talking about is shared by all the protestors the majority of gazans and their government almost all of the media figures and pop academics the radical position is hamas houthis and hezbollah are righteous for attacking civilians and oct th was mostly done by the idf just it being a genocide and supporting a one state is the most mainstream and least radical pro palestine position yeah mlk mandela and the old ira were not kidnapping civilians firing indiscriminately into civilian areas going on a raids where they attacked music festivals and none of the occupation struggles have ever been solved by a one state solution so not very relevant here yeah the people getting attacked more in a very visible war are getting more sympathy like you re saying religious extremism is the decider here while hamas is an openly religious extremist theocracy that s just silly in reality support for removing hamas is up after oct th and still higher now than before in reality support for a one state solution is still just as low globally in reality the courts have not sided with the pro palestinian groups on the genocide the icc declined to charge and the icj declined to issue a ceasefire so that one stat is cool but it hasn t made the mainstream palestinian position any more succesful everyone is still at a two state solution based on peace deals which is exactly where we were when clinton tried to do the same thing decades ago you seem unaware of the irony in what you re saying here because you don t know the history the arab peace initiative was a sentence proposal made without any negotiations that came right after arafat walked away from the actual negotiations and a peace deal that gave him more than he came asking for hamas has never recognized israel s right to exist and the mainstream palestinian position is still a one state in contradiction with the international position so the extremism you just pointed to in israel is the exact same reasons people disagree with the mainstream palestinian position due to its extremism this situation has only further reinforced people being moderate on this issue and supporting the same solution they did under clinton

the icj s provisional measures were ordered because israel s actions met the legal threshold for plausible genocide that s not gibberish it s international law the judge clarified the ruling didn t require final proof which takes years but your spin ignores the actual substance the court demanded israel prevent genocidal acts immediately oops as for starvation hunger and looming famine are stages in the process of mass starvation something only a genocide apologist would nitpick while gaza eats grass and no the un didn t walk back infant deaths it corrected one hospital claim while reporting thousands of dead children since but sure keep pretending a typo erases mass graves when your argument relies on technically they re not all dead yet you ve already lost no widespread starvation just starving and kids boiling leaves to eat no genocide ruling just the icj demanding israel stop genocidal acts keep lying the world sees the bones piling up

it s damn sure not a casualty rate

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-23 11:13:26+00:00 ---
the death toll is definitely in the s the number is only of confirmed dead who have been officially recorded it does not count people missing bodies not recovered under rubble bodies that have been vaporized etc the healthcare system also took a major hit logistically with functional equipment shortages and record keeping has become incredibly difficult

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-11-11 14:46:08+00:00 ---
hard to grasp the point here it s likely or more people have been killed already but there are no effective ways of counting the dead as many remain buried under rubble and the local healthcare infrastructure has been destroyed but op wishes to share his original research re the age and gender of the deceased

i m talking about civilians do you have a source for those casualties gen i haven t been able to find one and i want to stay informed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-22 03:40:15+00:00 ---
not the first time in history where one side starts a war and ends up having many more casualties rule prohibits me from detailing but i ll bet you could find the numbers yourself

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-18 23:50:38+00:00 ---
that doesn t really proves that they are counting natural deaths as war casualties only that they are focusing on reporting war casualties

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-10 17:36:18+00:00 ---
did you look at it it does not contain the word casualty but the legend states red is for injuries and black is for deaths

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-27 18:20:59+00:00 ---
no way most of them wanted more deaths

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-24 01:23:46+00:00 ---
my bad on the math military strategists still say the number is low for the situation and wow you do a quote about millions dying that s way off from what happened in this war

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-18 07:04:49+00:00 ---
certainly i don t know how they re counting casualties but i watched the video and i think there were some casualties

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-15 03:08:34+00:00 ---
since you seem to know about math i am going to copy and paste my comment from elsewhere i found the effect really interesting i understand that this seems extremely interesting i was captivated myself the issue is that this analysis in the tablet article looks at the total cumulative deaths instead of the number of deaths per day which adds a huge amount of bias into the system to oversimplify it is easy to find a trend that is just the numbers of deaths go up every day this short post breaks down the math

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-09 21:31:47+00:00 ---
does it give more concrete numbers of how those percentages are distributed i noticed it say so how many of these deaths were children minors it seems a bit disingenuous to call this combat aged fatalities well i m being careful here it s not just a bit disingenuous it s very deliberate language

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-21 20:30:05+00:00 ---
hundreds he ran over hundreds of dead and alive human beings with a tank depraved doesn t even begin to describe this

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-15 17:34:04+00:00 ---
i mean you re not wrong but the us hasn t been putting out alternative facts about the civilian death toll etc i m not saying it s unquestionable but i don t think you can just automatically dismiss it either

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-28 21:06:58+00:00 ---
it far surpasses any modern count of civilian deaths are you serious

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-03 07:31:44+00:00 ---
i mean as i said the numbers historically have been accurate and if you just look at the number of children and women killed it will tell you they are not military targets clearly using that as an excuse is disgusting and deplorable have some shame

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-17 00:25:58+00:00 ---
the best question to ask anyone before discussing anything about the death toll is what number of dead noncombatants would no longer be justified if they can t provide a clear answer either in concrete or abstract they re probably just interested in the numbers to justify further violence

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-14 22:55:52+00:00 ---
initially my only reasoning was that if you are counting bodies it makes sense that you can only do so many per day so it s logical that the number would reach a daily average i m not even commenting on the accuracy of the reported number of casualties or the accuracy of the analysis my only point is that the claim it s statistically improbable that around ppl are dying a day so the numbers are fake there s no possible explanation for the numbers to be so regular from day to day my explanation would be that they can only count around per hours and that explains the regularity in the daily reports that seems to be a very reasonable explanation to me at least i m not even claiming i m right just that ppl saying there s no way to explain this feels weird when there is a reasonable explanation even if it s incorrect it s still a logical explanation it s like saying this person claimed to be underwater for minutes they are clearly lying because no one can hold their breath that long there s no other explanation maybe they had a snorkel or scuba gear or were in a submarine etc the person could be lying but that doesn t negate other possibilities

ok but have you seen the death toll comparisons

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-07-08 00:25:08+00:00 ---
there are already multiple of thousands of deaths because these were the only reported as i said it is obvious that you gonna stand up for your people and i will also stand with mine no point in arguing with people like you who swear to get their point across

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-10 23:45:41+00:00 ---
yet still the western media state the death toll is around k it s been that number for months they refuse to acknowledge it is massively underreported

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-01 20:08:14+00:00 ---
any update on casualties

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-16 13:45:39+00:00 ---
i can see that because ofcourse we want some of those who deserve the help to get it i have no clue what the difficulties are when it comes to vetting people but i do hope that whatever casualties can be stopped will be stopped appreciate the response

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-19 17:19:01+00:00 ---
euromed monitor is one of the most reliable sources on death count

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-24 18:52:33+00:00 ---
that number is outdated wrong irrelevant and misleading that was the number of people confirmed killed that were not part of any security force police officers are peaceful people even soldiers they were not engaged into any military activities other than security defence when they were attacked they were peaceful people and that when the death count was still at it is closer to now but either way lets say your number is the right one oh pardon me my bad i thought they had brutally butchered people but since it was just then it s fine the kind of stuff one says when they ar eon the wrong and have no valid argument left

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-10 18:26:11+00:00 ---
nobody knows the casualty numbers so they can be even higher

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-22 04:26:01+00:00 ---
this data point date was chosen because it gave specific insight into exact totals of male female children fatalities no it doesn t you can t extrapolate from confirmed deaths to all deaths full stop

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-20 06:32:22+00:00 ---
or maybe the number of women and children casualties are fabricated there was someone here who noticed discrepancy in them previously i ll link it later

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-17 04:49:30+00:00 ---
what about them they are casualties of war same as thousands of people across the globe

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-05 00:08:34+00:00 ---
as little casualties being k died and even bigger number injured but the number is small right y all brain died

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-05 20:12:37+00:00 ---
i agree but i ve still yet to see any analysis that indicates their numbers are false i d love to see something by experts analyzing casualty patterns comparing the data to prior wars or even pointing to known errors in the tally but i haven t seen anything to go by other than the reasonable suspicion that the ghm is cooking the books i was hoping this would be just such an analysis but i don t think they ve got it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-03 16:15:07+00:00 ---
enemy civilian casualties are always more acceptable to a nation at war than casualties among their own population this question comes up regularly and the answer is always the same sure i totally understand that but you re avoiding the question i want to know what number you think is acceptable ok that s how war works so tell me within it working that way what s acceptable to you

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-20 04:49:02+00:00 ---
it s a bit gosh to squabble over what the exact number of people that were intentionally murdered was

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-19 12:31:38+00:00 ---
let me ask you one question where do you get your number on civillians that were killed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-21 17:16:32+00:00 ---
well there is a absolute rule in military history enemy loses always inflated no matter what its was newer been a question for me that number in not real is it as low as probably not naturally named database number would be lower then real but clearly real numbers somewhat between thousand

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-14 19:35:33+00:00 ---
so what is the death toll then

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-24 02:01:03+00:00 ---
i don t understand metrics like this do people not understand how many kids die every year or how much is hours seems long to me too thinking how long it would take to read even k names

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-09 06:03:44+00:00 ---
yes they are counting everyone and multiple times a family or friends can report a death and it goes on the spreadsheet there is a lot of duplicate and ficticious data

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-13 17:52:13+00:00 ---
do you have numbers of death in the south comlared to the north you seem like a numbers guy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-19 12:31:25+00:00 ---
let me ask you one question where do you get your number on civillians that were killed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 02:06:12+00:00 ---
presumably those people are expecting the death rate to increase

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-07 14:42:53+00:00 ---
i ve read they are literally using the same flawed logic that uses and i ve debated him extensively on this issue and yet he still always engages in a pattern of his own denial so what irrelevant counter point occupation high casualties that they are always inconsistent about like always changing the number and god knows what else

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-07 05:57:11+00:00 ---
of the population being killed is the ones they can count everyone knows the number is significantly higher it s not possible that it wouldn t be

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-12-18 21:11:15+00:00 ---
is there any evidence those deaths are being considered in the moh count at all

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-14 16:01:54+00:00 ---
that is not even remotely true it s not even as many as in the iraq war alone

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-23 02:15:30+00:00 ---
i think it was a french analysis claim iirc though any sane person knows it can t be they legit claimed deaths minutes after the impact

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-15 20:22:27+00:00 ---
so what would be a reasonable expected civilian casualty count at this point in order to say a number is too high you have to have some concept of what is low or not high

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-27 20:50:57+00:00 ---
died in the lot those are not made up was obviously an estimate

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-22 11:39:53+00:00 ---
so we are arbitrarily choosing timeframes to compare them and only counting the deaths in one camp of one of them so we are still just forging numbers to make some specific look bad

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-22 00:56:59+00:00 ---
there is sufficient evidence to believe that the death count which is currently is severely undercounted so isn t out of the question but i will edit above response to remove unnecessary editorialization

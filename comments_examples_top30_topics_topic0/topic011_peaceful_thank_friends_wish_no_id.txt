according to you who is the side that repeatedly said no to peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-07-03 18:30:03+00:00 ---
sounds like an extremely toxic mentality by sore losers to give a higher meaning to their attrocities sometimes peace is achieved because of injustices

some might argue some won t i don t see the point in such resistance if peace begets peace and growth holding onto a fallacy of we will take back everything even that which wasn t ours will ultimately lead to utter destruction it s like weighing options and it s a terrible one what in the long run will save more lives destroying your enemies or continuing to fight another years do you lose million to war or million over the next few decades or potentially everything

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-29 20:10:38+00:00 ---
yes peace and justice can be achieved with equal rights for all and right of return

i wish you well too i think too often what happens is people are caught up in emotion and misunderstand each other no one in this thread finds joy in the atrocities of war and conflict

you make peace with your enemies not with your friends that is completely backwards

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-04 10:12:17+00:00 ---
wild how peace is only sacred when the oppressed are asking for justice but y all love violence when it s wrapped in a flag and a founding myth

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-14 12:33:43+00:00 ---
i understand that on the left people want peace which is a weird position to take when you have people who want to kill you because of your race

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-21 21:46:57+00:00 ---

--- subreddit: worldnews | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-15 19:32:15+00:00 ---
this is deep but quite on point peace means relenquishing land and living in harmony

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2020-07-06 12:08:36+00:00 ---
ok so if i adopt your terminology i think people should side with the people who want peace rather than people who want their side to win i think we are basically saying the same thing

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-06 17:15:48+00:00 ---
the whole religion of peace thing

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-12 19:30:39+00:00 ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-20 23:33:44+00:00 ---
if you accept subjugation there would be peace as well no

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-17 15:22:41+00:00 ---
time to surrender and make peace i guess

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-28 18:40:52+00:00 ---
what bothers me the most is how close peace always actually is if you look at the balkans it seems that a single generation of relative peace with subsequent increases in living conditions is enough to seriously deflate the desire for war it s not a guarantee but it ought to be the goal

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-06 23:41:05+00:00 ---
this is so hard to watch such hate please may peace come soon and let us be the best not the worst of humanity

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-30 16:55:13+00:00 ---
do you think someone saying yes to your question automatically brings about peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-13 19:21:55+00:00 ---

i am all for peace people are people to me regardless of their ethnicity religious or any other type of beliefs the one thing we need to do is respect each other even if we don t always agree diversity of opinions and healthy debate is good everyone s opinion is valued and considered is how it should be acceptance and forgiveness is the key to reconciliation thanks for the post peace shalom salaam

no justice no peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-03 14:56:38+00:00 ---
if you really want what you ve said the true way starts with justice after that other important things can flourish too like education you ll never have peace beat them into submission or teach them to love you with a whole people still living under systematic brutal injustice and military occupation the status quo for decades now two peoples having the same rights law and dignity in one federal state or two states is the only way to future and lasting peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-03-26 04:29:14+00:00 ---

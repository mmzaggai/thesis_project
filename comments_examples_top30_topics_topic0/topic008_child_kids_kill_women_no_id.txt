in response to your edit i was the first to respond to your question and i thought i d answered it what answer would be acceptable to you it s common sense not to have children in a whole load of situations but people do it and have done for thousands and thousands of years

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-23 18:20:15+00:00 --- ---
i find this so ironic in light of the young kids and children dancing around and celebrating these babies deaths are you blind or just refuse to see reality staring back at you

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-25 21:08:22+00:00 --- ---
i mean how is saying i care about the health and well being of all children even remotely political if someone doesn t agree with that sentiment it should just be a red flag

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-31 18:58:15+00:00 --- ---
a child who killed people huh

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-24 01:07:23+00:00 --- ---
the kids are alright

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-26 14:08:38+00:00 --- ---
i don t think we should kill kids tho seems wrong

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-22 09:32:15+00:00 --- ---
that s a bad argument the parents of a child killed in a car accident grieve just as much as well the parents of a child that a serial killer merely tried to murder and is still alive grieve much less than either that doesn t mean car accidents are as much a of a crime morally and legally as invading a house and shooting a child point blank or that attempted murder is no crime at all any modern system of morality and law makes critical distinctions between these cases based on the mindset of the perpetrator that grieving parents will not the philosophy you seem to be following is the eye for an eye you killed three of our children we re allowed to kill three of yours pre modern one this is strongly rejected by the civilized world

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-13 14:18:32+00:00 --- ---
by not supporting the indiscriminate killing of literal fucking children cool

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-19 19:11:27+00:00 --- ---
it seems you use innocent and noncombatant interchangeably which makes no sense also i don t know about you but i think not defending your children against brutal murderers would be morally unacceptable that s not the point though the only thing i was trying to say is that if you support resistance or even if you personally do not but most people around you do you shouldn t be so surprised when the target of your resistance will resist back in a most unpleasant way

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-09 17:02:01+00:00 --- ---
i mean what you are saying here essentially is only my side may brutalise and kill children

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-01 20:41:07+00:00 --- ---
they killed children

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-25 10:12:42+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-06 21:18:54+00:00 --- ---
so i should trust you rather than a doctor from norway who is working in the hospitals you really don t have a problem with children being killed that s actually crazy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-06 04:32:35+00:00 --- ---
you don t want to have a discussion you want to openly justify why thousands of babies children and women and innocent men are getting murdered in droves

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-26 15:42:15+00:00 --- ---
then defending children is justified

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-17 03:02:45+00:00 --- ---
this is an insane idea the closest comparison is that of a child trying to debate their way out of eating their vegetables do you condemn human suffering i was banned from this sub for this post as this was deemed attacking a reddit user

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-26 07:41:08+00:00 --- ---
they also say innocent children when referring to anyone under casually justifying the killing of children

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-01 03:54:07+00:00 --- ---

are you really trying to justify in your head the deaths of innocent children look at it this way if you do the same or worse than your enemy then you are behaving worse than your enemy if someone wants to be better than others it needs to reflect that on their acts not on excuses and lies

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-27 19:59:43+00:00 --- ---

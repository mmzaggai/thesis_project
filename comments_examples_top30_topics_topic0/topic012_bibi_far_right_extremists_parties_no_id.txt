--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-20 15:56:29+00:00 ---
probably nothing trump scolded bibi likely negating repeated actions and we are not seeing violence

i don t hate bibi but i don t think he s a good leader for israel anymore im not right but i m not super left either politics in general are just terrifying there needs to be more middle ground imo i m very center and don t envy those making decisions higher up as there is no good answer to this terrible situation

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-02 23:51:42+00:00 ---
that s why bibi has a tantrum every time he perceives even a potential delay in aid from the us lmao

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-30 18:22:27+00:00 ---
men i hope i voted five times the past few years and it has been rough i m not giving up though and proud to cast my vote for the democrats i don t think bibi will go to jail unfortunately but i just want him to not ruin us anymore

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-09 08:14:14+00:00 ---
yeah wait till you hear about how bibi himself had an active hand in letting this evil come about in the first place

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-09 16:49:50+00:00 ---
with you bro you all need to have that mindset and let bibi do his work stop protesting against it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-16 11:35:59+00:00 ---
the palestinian government in the west bank is peaceful they genuinely want to solve this in peaceful ways they have no army maybe some armed police forces but that s it but i don t see anything done by your government to proceed abbas himself said that bibi refused to talk to him in the past years or so what i propose is borders where jerusalem is an international city that s under the protection of un army that s the only solution i truly wish someday we will look back at this and laugh

bibi is the worst without netanyahu s reign and israels right wing there would not have been a oct and children deaths there might have been another rabin and there might have been peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-13 17:34:52+00:00 ---
i m no bibi fan but it sounds like you need to do more research

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-20 11:34:06+00:00 ---
yes exactly and bibi s not the guy to do it he s the warhawk it s war now and israel must win it but there ll be a time for peace after and things may look different then i hope

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-17 19:18:30+00:00 ---
bibi was democratically elected by israelis several times over israelis accuse all palestinians of being terrorists because hamas was elected decades ago when the majority of gazans weren t even born the same logic can be applied to israelis as well since they overheleming support the genocide of palestinians and re elect this blood thirsty war criminal again and again

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-22 21:43:29+00:00 ---
i think this is solid unfortunately i think bibi will continue his reign for a while when tensions like this rise and war breaks out the last thing israelis want is a shake up of the political system what most israelis want is for the hostages to come home if they re even still alive and for hamas to be held accountable for its many many crimes my hope is bibi will see this fighting until the end whatever the end might be and israel elects a new leader one who is more open to discussions with the pa and doesn t have a history of fraud

i m anti netanhayu too this guy is a complete moron and should be in jail people who vote for him don t understand his real position because he s a snake or were soused to the likud s older position they didn t realise they got completely corrupted when bibi joined he s like the israeli trump horrible in every way yet people still vote for him for some reason

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-28 07:11:17+00:00 ---
because israel has been committing mass slaughter and starvation and destruction of innocent ppl so if bibi talks about being thankful for hitting civilians he would be thankful whereas iran hasn t and ppl sympathetize with them a bit so wouldn t get the same treatment

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-17 23:32:58+00:00 ---
there s some basis for this idea in likud thought olmert in said a similar idea in the negative that part of the reason for withdrawal from gaza was to preempt pal demand for the vote could bibi have been holding a wb ss idea in reserve so that when international pressure gets too great he ll spring it on everyone and betray his far right allies that are sure to object possibly but the idea has some merit i think his political career is over though it s just a question of when

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-03 00:53:20+00:00 ---
how do you remove the org when they are spread across different countries that you cannot invade and bomb you might be able to reduce numbers but the idea of resistance on the palestinian side won t go away and it certainly won t die after what s happening now bibi could be using this to deflect from his own struggles in leadership and pushback he was getting before this all started but i agree will be hard to work with this leadership once the dust settles

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-29 18:42:29+00:00 ---
yeah bibi is facing corruption charges he doesn t have massive support from the public he recently passed a law to prevent acting leaders from facing criminal charges his goal is to stir up enough hate in the israeli public that way it doesn t matter if he lacks support because as long as he keeps the war going he can stay in power

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-21 16:45:18+00:00 ---
i felt a lot of division w in the israel society even under the unifying slogan of bring them home some israel colleagues were openly saying that they are making plans to move abroad should bibi win again

nakba looks like tuesday

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-30 15:17:30+00:00 ---
it is a deliberate strategy by israel to indulge in people s pre existing biases against muslims its why bibi loves to say do you support israel or do you support radical islam or hamas to a western layman that simplicity makes the answer clearly israel

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-14 13:59:06+00:00 ---
exhibit right here no party seems to have a serious platform besides bibi not bibi

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-07-10 20:37:47+00:00 ---
you never know surname bibi

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-30 01:41:20+00:00 ---
bibi s position has always been that there will never be a palestinian state i have responded to dozens of comments on this you want to be nitpicky about me saying he never stated as opposed to his position has always been then go ahead it doesn t change the facts

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-01 02:18:00+00:00 ---
and bibi too i wanted them both on trial

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-10 20:51:43+00:00 ---
bildu isn t a broadly supported party in spain it is nothing but a basque left wing party saying people in spain started to support bildu when the only support they have is from a few hundred thousand left wing basques who want national sovereignty is so hyperbolic it verges on an outright lie

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-30 04:55:41+00:00 ---
just like many people i hate bibi i hate him with passion i truly believe that this vile of a human is the reason that the hamas was able to pull this off you re using the definition of genocide wrong while i hate bibi he was democratically elected and so did the hamas bibi is irrelevant to the argument here i m allowed to defend myself the hamas takes the route of using palestinians and kids like moppets and shields your inability to accept this is terrible

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-08 04:53:42+00:00 ---
you ve got yourself a deal especially if you throw in getting rid of bibi

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-09 18:04:40+00:00 ---
no bibi said it was to keep the pa down did hamas do a deception yes but israel bought that deception to keep the pa down it would not surprise me the israeli govt they secretly approved of oct as a master stroke to keep bibi in power but that would be a conspiracy theory based on no evidence but would not surprise me on the bonkers of israel behavior aka creating hamas and funding them indirectly before oct hell even if they did it openly you would keep bibi i think israel is lost in bloodlust and bibi is a master of keeping the wars going

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-29 21:48:37+00:00 ---
the palestinian leadership have also done so they have thwarted any separation of a palestinian state from israeli control both by tanking negotiations and by thwarting israeli attempts at unilateral disengagement and the question is about recognition of the state of palestine not whether you like bibi so palestinian leadership and governance is more at issue here or are least it should be

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-09 05:23:51+00:00 ---
just stop the killing and stealing get rid of bibi be a real democracy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-01 14:28:58+00:00 ---
pretty sure bibi licks his lips in situations like these

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-12 22:47:27+00:00 ---
until a certain bibi

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-21 13:27:31+00:00 ---
but we shouldn t forget that netanyahu financed them and without him they would never be as strong as today i disagree i think that with or without bibi the general conception was to weaken the palestinian authority and isolate gaza from the west bank this is to avoid the threat of a palestinian country suffocating israel from both sides but it not the case for israeli generals this is not policy and this is false what you re saying is false accusations that damage the image of israel and idf without any proof the israeli people hould stand against his government israeli people have stood against their government when necessary this is not one of those times also my personal opinion is that israel cannot win a war against a terrorist organization abiding to international laws of war but that s just me

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-11 00:12:24+00:00 ---
i m not pretending that bibi cares for them but israel demanded them back countless times and hamas refused under unacceptable terms

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2020-08-04 15:01:29+00:00 ---
right but consider that bibi s policies are popular mainstream and have consensus support this isn t polarization essentially of israeli voters want someone other than bibi to implement policies relatively close to the ones bibi would implement likud will not pick anyone other than bibi to lead it by a margin there is no way to achieve a stable governing coalition at this point without likud blue and white in particular wasn t stable enough to survive the pressure of governing with a diverse coalition and the other coalition parties were too narrow in the end though gideon saar and benny gantz not being able to take the reins proves they don t have what it takes to lead a country the left over the course of the last year really dealt with some long term deep seated issues i think that s improvement for israel long term so i m hopeful you aren t stuck with bibi until the s

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-23 00:58:31+00:00 ---

israel systematically targeted and killed all peaceful palestinian leaders through mossad assassinations in hope of undermining a two state solution bibi literally created this situation how are israelis not furious with him

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-28 04:40:29+00:00 ---

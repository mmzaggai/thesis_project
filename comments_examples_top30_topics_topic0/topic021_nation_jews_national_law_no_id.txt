because i was talking about the factual construction of a sociology category used by israel to organise its future citizens as part of the million plan lol benny shabeebo says it best facts don t care about feelings i have no idea how you think that means they don t have rights to self determination

this is like saying sure the u s displaced and killed native americans but it s discriminatory to question americans right to self determination see the problem it centers the legitimacy of the conquerors while sidelining the people who were dispossessed the issue isn t denying jewish existence it s that palestinian self determination has been denied for years and your framing erases that

basic law in isreal states that only jewis people have the right to national self determination and that israel is a state specifically for the jewish people

yes in principle self determination is a universal right but in practice the call for a palestinian state today is almost always rooted in the idea of historic injustice i e they were here first or they had their land stolen any call for restitution of a crime is rooted in the history of that crime having happened not only that but the call for palestinian freedom is in relation to crimes and human rights abuses happening right now right this second you can t invoke history as the foundation of your political grievance then pivot to modern liberal ideals when challenged the argument flips back and forth depending on which version sounds more persuasive in the moment the modern liberal ideas were current with the time of the crimes the universal decleration of human rights for instance was proclaimed in the same year laws are not retroactive and don t apply to before they were formed but the basis of modern international law customary law hague conventions un charter etc were already in place it is holding people to the rights which were in place at the time which are also the rights that are in place now also israel didn t appear in a vacuum it was created legally through the un in response to both jewish self determination and jewish persecution this is outright wrong israel was never created by the un jewish people proclaimed it themselves if both peoples have rights to self determination why is the palestinian claim the only one considered non negotiable while israel s legitimacy is constantly attacked because self determination is a right that exists within international norms it allows a group of people to make collective decisions about their governance it does not give a people free reign to overrule and commit war crimes and human rights abuses against another people this is a false equivalence and a deliberate misuse of the word apartheid the world court aka the international court of justice has found israel guilty of apartheid major black south african apartheid leaders like desmond tutu have stated that israel is comitting apartheid millions of people live in oppression because they do not fit the ethnoreligious background of the ruling class israeli arabs million people have full rights including voting political parties supreme court justices and open participation in society that s not apartheid so of the nearly million arabs uner israeli control around a quarter of them have full right which is in fact not full rights as israel discriminates against the palestinians within israel both on a de jure and de facto basis and the other million don t matter because as long as you offer full rights to a faction of an ethnicity you can oppress the rest as much as you like

oh please do tell how is believing in the right of self determination of a group of people is considered racist or is it only because they are jews

you must be really blind c the right to exercise national self determination in the state of israel is unique to the jewish people

self determination is on the land you are living on like the kurds catalans invading another land and expelling the local population is not self determination it is colonization like the zionists called their movement

it could also be seen as a nationalistic issue self determination of peoples is a concept a lot of right wing parties adhere to as well the importance of territorial integrity with regards to the expansion of west bank settlements could be used as a more right wing argument as well for recognition the reality is you could bend and frame this issue any way you want to

which is true why the only national self determination movement that is criticized is the jewish one

no because i don t believe self determination as it is typically defined is a right i m trying to argue against it by using an example of how ridiculous a position it is when you take it to its logical conclusion people have the right to democracy to fair treatment to cultural freedoms but i certainly don t think people have a right to a country where the national group they identify as is a demographic majority otherwise there would need to be something like thousands of new countries established along with several hundred ethnic cleansing and population transfer campaigns for this to be satisfied

the people who were displaced from that land might have had their nation taken away from them by your logic muslim migrants in europe should have self determination too

i might not be fully up on israeli law in what way do non jewish israeli citizens lack self determination are you referring to the basic law can you point me to any past reddit comment where you have called another nation illegitimate or said it has forfeited its right to exist

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-05 19:59:58+00:00 ---
i m not op but in my opinion it s less so about rights to self determination and more so about the fact that nobody asked the palestinians how they felt about the state of israel being formed in

i don t think self determination is a gift but i also don t think palestinians care about that much because for them this is a religious war further i don t support netanyahu or his far right govt and hope when he is eventually tried for corruption he is found guilty i too support that partition plan but it s my opinion based on the actions of arabs since israel s founding that they don t actually want their own country they want the land of israel and they want jews gone and we know this is true because they are still arguing for right to return or a ss which is literally never happening i think their positions are unrealistic even under a reasonable israeli govt i mean they had a chance at self rule in gaza and completely fuct themselves who will represent them with realistic goals these are the rational questions i have been asking among pro palestinian folks and even jewish supporters of ss cannot answer after all arabs do not think like westerners pan arabism is a large reason why they have never accepted their own state and why they continue to use terrorism to reach their goals my goal is also for less dead jews admittedly i hold a lot of conflicting thoughts about this because i support a ss but after don t expect to see it in my lifetime i m late s so i have lots of ideas but most are unfeasible under netanyahu but with that said hamas needs to be eradicated this is a rambling post because my thoughts on this topic are vast and varied and conflict with each other

you support self determination but then deny self determination of the jews america is the next best thing for jews they re jews have no voice in any government except for israel despite what antisemites would like to say just based on demographics alone in fact the choice to create israel without conducting a democratic vote or being decided by democratically elected representatives is anti self determination you realize in the partition plan there were arab leaders and the yishuv right the arab leadership refused the yishuv agreed done if you wanted a direct election plebiscite we know what the outcome would ve been for the arabs for jews jews are overruled then what happens during when the jewish population doubles we ll just end up with the same war we had in we just delayed it for years we can t just create states willy nilly correct we created a country where jews were the majority jewish borders had a jewish majority if you didn t know for kurdish self determination it ll be in kurdistan not jerusalem if you didn t know for uyghur self determination it ll be in xinjiang not jerusalem if you didn t know self determination is not an infinite right it is literally a building block of modern international law and fundamentally formed the world as we know it current borders of europe decolonization non european nationalism etc let s say the confederates won the civil war would it be discriminatory to southern americans say that the confederacy shouldn t exist strawman confederates are americans they simply hold different ideological beliefs it is not the same situation what does the jewish people having a state mean to you means jews should have a homeland in their homeland thats what it always has meant for all of history say what you want about theodore hertzl or the thousand racist comments made by zionist leaders despite the fact they lived in a radically different time zionism was never first and foremost to kill all palestinians arabs whatever it was to make a safe homeland for the jewish people by jews for jews that s it i don t consider states as belonging to any group except for all the inhabitants who live in them agreed that s why there have been one hundred historical arab members that why israeli arabs can vote live freely have the right to be muslim can pray in the temple mount despite what assholes like ben gvir are doing and a plethora of other things

there is no basic human right for self determination this is a fallacy i support a palestinian state but just as there is no inherent right to land there is no inherent right to self determination also intifada has a very specific meaning in this context whatever meaning it might have had in other areas is not relevant saying israeli sovereignty is not the same as palestine will be free because again they explicitly say they will kick all jews out just talk to palestinians who say from the river to the sea and listen to what they want check corey on youtube and you will realize this is exactly what of them want at least publicly

they do have the right to self determination and they could already have it if they weren t so determined to prevent jews from realizing that same right jerusalem is tricky there s no question but a right to self determination and a right to a specific city are very different questions

i don t need a statistic just trust me no i never said anything about denying jewish people the right to self determination forcing people out of their homes mass murdering children and enacting fascist control over non israeli groups is not what self determination is

so jews should be a minority everywhere they live with no practical self determination

the movement of jews wanting self determination is the cause of discrimination against jews do you hear yourself

palestine does have land under its control its interesting how zionists talk about self determination yet deny others the opportunity to exercise their rights to self determination

self determination is the right of people to choose who governs them international law supports self determination for all people i support self determination for all people but zionism is not the right to self determination nor does the right to self determination mean you can create a country of any size in any location you d like that would be a ridiculous belief in fact the choice to create israel without conducting a democratic vote or being decided by democratically elected representatives is anti self determination in all there is a limited amount of land we can t just create states willy nilly wherever we d like and call it a violation of self determination whenever people don t like it overall self determination is not an infinite right i can t as an american declare my property my own country and claim that this is my right to self determination lets say you re anti american or believe the americans specifically don t need a state or even america doesn t need to have a state with dc at it s capital or america shouldn t exist because manifest destiny let s say the confederates won the civil war would it be discriminatory to southern americans say that the confederacy shouldn t exist anti zionism on the other hand is a belief that the jewish people specifically shouldn t have a state for one reason or another what does the jewish people having a state mean to you personally i don t consider states as belonging to any group except for all the inhabitants who live in them i think israel should equally be a state for jews christians muslims etc

okay the israeli constitution literally says that the right of self determination is only for the jewish people it literally says that no one minds having a safe haven for any population of people it becomes a problem when you kick out original inhabitants of the region and occupy their lands again because a population lived there for a long time a thousand years ago does not given that population the right to occupy or kick or colonize another population this is literally not true the whole premise of israel in the late s was based on colonizing palestine and kicking everyone out look at number one again

because we live in a shared observed reality someone can claim that new yorkers aren t just american therefore they deserve self determination but if the rest of the world sees them simply as americans nothing will drastically change and they will forever be just americans on the other hand someone can claim that kosovans aren t just serbians therefore they deserve self determination and if the world observes reality the same way they do then they will obtain it that s how kosovo is now a country while palestine and new york are not

my grandma s family lived in jerusalem for generations there were always jews in israel but surprisingly no one seems to remember that or challenge the fact that the natives have some kind of moral right to have it all even though many of them arrived at the th and early th century the awakening of nationalism swept both jews and palestinians who had never expressed a desire for self determination before this wave and were considered an extension of neighboring countries especially syria i m not claiming they aren t entitled to self determination only that the jews are as well

the idea to have a land for jewish to self determination where a native population already exists and without the consideration of including others right to self determination even after it been proven that this land is their ancestral homeland too is a racist ideology that s not a racist ideology nor what happened originally it was just for a homeland then decades of violence proved the need for a state had the palestinians accepted the partition plan rather than starting a civil war everything would have been fine instead they started a war because they wanted jews to be subservient it does when the founders of this ideology planned a land that no arab or what they refer to it arabness shows what they actually mean by self determination without the regard of the non jews population of palestine the racism is in the foundation of the movement they didn t plan for a land without arabs though israel passed a controversial new nation state law last week that s sparking fierce debate over the very nature of israel itself the law does three big things it states that the right to exercise national self determination in israel is unique to the jewish people it establishes hebrew as israel s official language and downgrades arabic a language widely spoken by arab israelis to a special status it establishes jewish settlement as a national value and mandates that the state will labor to encourage and promote its establishment and development this nation state law says a lot about the reality of having a state only for jews to self determination as i said above the movement ideology is only sounds peaceful in papers this nation state law says a lot about the reality of having a state only for jews to self determination as i said above the movement ideology is only sounded peaceful in papers where did you copy paste them from the nation state law was years ago not last week and you have the same paragraph in there twice the nation law doesn t do anything in practice it does not say only jews have self determination it says national self determination as in a separate state can t be broken off from it it doesn t stop non jewish israelis from voting immigrating isn t the same as an occupation zionists occupied lands because they used force jews have been immigrating from europe to palestine and other parts of the arabic world and that wasn t a problem zionists immigrated to the land the only occupation is in the west bank you said a lot of jews believe in the zionist s ideology and that s sad if a group of muslims followed extreme ideas i will say the same please don t use this card it just shows the bankruptcy of what you stand for it s literally you dehumanizing jews and then attacking me afterwards believing in self determination for an indigenous population isn t extreme

i don t agree but it s irrelevant the palestinian people are entitled to self determination however you feel about the state you conjecture it would lead to

my point was what is unique about jewish self determination that it requires a jewish state to exist couldn t a pluralistic democratic non ethnostate suffice confusing nationalism for self determination is a recipe for disaster as we ve seen over the last years that aside whether an idea is popular among a group or not does not mean that you can use the group and the idea interchangeably which is what happens frequently to conflate anti zionism and real antisemetism as one and the same

the right to self determination is a central part of international law which applies to jews in israel you will have to deal with that

now who is using the ad homonim argument while there isn t a specific clause guaranteeing the right to exist for states in international law the concept of statehood sovereignty and self determination are foundational principles international law recognizes states as the primary subjects and their existence is intertwined with these core principles just from google for what that s worth a nation is its people genocide of a people is genocide of its nation and vice versa

jews deserve the right to self determination as much as any ethnic group not more not less agreed but i don t think any ethnic group would have been entitled in this situation we can argue all day long about who deserves what but at the end of the day israel exists and it s not going anywhere the best anyone can hope for now is peace and a two state solution sadly i agree only practical solution is peace via a reasonable two state solution

does it really matter whether or not the specific land is a country it s outside of israels borders and the people who have lived their for generations or were displaced there have the right to self determination identities and labels change all the time and we don t question it for other groups

self determination is not when you displace and murder the local inhabitants to create the so called state in question first off current day israelis didn t do that their ancestors did and if we are going to apply that standard then the palestinians don t deserve self determination since the arab society they represent displaced and destroyed the byzantine civilization that came before them in an invasion

how come jews don t have the right of self determination or even the right to live in their land how come palestinians don t have the right to self determination in their land palestinians are the indigenous group it doesn t matter that jewish israelis can trace their heritage years back since they are actively ethnically cleansing palestine in favour of jews

arabs are born in israel yet they have no right to self determination in israel

what does it even mean hypothetically if arabs had the right to self determination in israel what would that look like would they get to carve out a piece of the country for themselves most countries don t let minority ethnic groups do this israel is not unique

what do you think of self determination by displacing indigenous populations that s racist and i advise that you learn about this term you re using zionism it was a political movement before the holocaust most jews did not support it and palestine was not the sole option amongst zionists for a homeland zionism clearly did not see palestine as their entitlement until long after read ilan pappe s the ethnic cleansing of palestine

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-22 07:17:18+00:00 ---
so if the jews living there wanted self determination don t they deserve it as well

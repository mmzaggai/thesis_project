you re not indigenous to that land you re white white people come from europe that s why they have the name ashkenaz which literally means germany and in genesis says you are the grandson of japheth your people are genetically closest to turks iranians and and the southern caucus regions if you look ancient paintings of the hebrews they were medium to dark skin with dark curly hair not even the color of the shephardic jews but darker like south indians africans and melanesians melanesians

those eastern european colonizers by which i assume you mean ashkenazi jews have surprisingly little eastern european dna most of the european component of ashkenazi dna is from southern europe particularly roman italy the middle eastern portion is predominantly levantine dna matters because it points to history

re aryan stuff and whiteness that s not how nazi racial theory rules worked the slavic peoples are definitely white but hitler s hierarchy placed them below germanic peoples and planned on killing half or more of them and keeping the rest as enslaved people but yeah jews are middle eastern even ashkenazim have clearly levantine dna

ashkenazi jews are not genetically half european for a majority of their time in europe they lived in insular communities with limited contact with outside populations genetic mixing eventually occured due violence committed against them during the middle ages and beyond there can be jews with european dna due to this mixing but ashkenazi jews on a basic level aren t european there was also a pretty big event in the s s where someone with an iconic mustache made it known that ashkenazis weren t european

it s just that i come across alot of blood libel in far leftist circles in the past who genuinely believe that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of khazars from central asia and i m getting sick of it tbh but yes i agree with you as well

people who made aliya from europe know their ancestry theyre called ashkenazi what is your comment trying to prove lmao

you are totally correct they use them as cannon fodder while the ashkenazi dominate the levers of power

what double standard why would you even bother denying that or more of jews are of european ancestory i would make the case that jews were opressed equally by christians and muslims but the reality is you ashkenazi don t look arab they ve done numerous dna samples and geneology studies all those studies point to a common conclusion your peoples mitochondrial dna your womens dna has evolved with anglo european dna now let me guess you re going to tell me that your ancestoral women willingly married barbaric germans saxons and french since the explusion from jeruselim by the italians

you ignored the rest of the paragraph where i explained how they were not deemed white either way the vast majority of ashkenazim are of white skin tone and thus white

ashkenazi jews are white mizrahi jews are middle eastern and spehardic jews are latino simple as that it doesn t need to be debated a million times i don t care about this debate as much as some people do and i think it s ridiculous how people keep trying to bring up ancestors or whatever

what an amazing post i m only posting this addition correction because you asked in the post title most people describe the different types of jewish people by region as ashkenazi or sephardic sephardic generically means from the middle east but i believe in actuality it is from spain portugal and the north part of the middle east mizrahi is the majority of the middle east and north africa i think technically mizrahi may be more accurate in the majority origin of jews but colloquially people refer to sephardic and ashkenazi there are also more details like people who came from the levant region or other specifics someone else can probably reply explain better than me

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-10 02:08:35+00:00 ---
theyre hiding the fact that the arab jewish survivors of ethnic cleansing in the mid east still exist so that ashkenazi jews can just be labeled as white and white people are all invalid white people can t even pronounce ashkenazi or know what a sephardic jew is

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-25 01:33:08+00:00 ---
sephardim are interesting they were expelled from iberia then expelled from morocco and some found themselves in the balkans such as in bulgaria others ended up in france but yeah from what i understand sephardim and mizrahi tended to be grouped together it s hard to nail them down as a result in a convenient race

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-14 15:42:44+00:00 ---
bro people are so stupid lol we re literally called jewish bc we come from judea mfs genuinely think ashkenazim descend from some random group of polish people who started spontaneously practicing a middle eastern culture and writing in a canaanite script in the middle of europe

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-06-25 05:02:56+00:00 ---
the classification of white is a us classification that classicially misidentifies the struggles that they go through with housing and other discrimination the group of people you speak of don t identify as white themselves because they are given the gift of white privileged and face discrimination disproportionately to white people so no muslim arabs jewish arabs palestinians and mizrahi jews are typically not identified as white and saying that they are is in fact racist and bigoted and i don t care if that upsets you don t say things that are racist and wrong

there seems to be some weird gerrymandering in favour of the ashkenazi there is gerrymandering the whole concept of gerrymandering isn t even possible in their system the whole country is one big electoral district

the largest demographic of jews in israel are mizrahi not ashkenazi this post completely ignores them

ashkenazi jews are eastern europeans migrating from spain to western europe after the crusades in the th century they fled to france germany england then went to eastern europe the word ashkenazi itself translates to german you are not indigenous to palestine there are however indigenous jews who live in palestine and these same jews are on the side of palestinian resistance not on the side of settlers

wrong studies have proven that ashkenazi jews are only about european and maintain significant canaanite ancestry furthermore mizrahi jews are of israel s jewish population

all jews share specific genes regardless of race and skin colour we are a very weird outlier

but the whole jews aren t white was propagated by the nazis the nazis didn t have white and non white as their dominant racial classifications things were much more finally grained that s why they allied with dark skinned indians and slaughtered slavs by the hundreds of thousands jews became invited to be white in the usa in the late s along with other subgroups of eastern and central europeans

ashkenazis are a mixture of levant other middle eastern such as iranian european genetically but the europeans do not see them as european ashkenazi jews were created because of being bottlenecked i wouldn t call them white gypsies but middle eastern gypsies if we re talking about how europeans would see them

nah bro a turkic group so called khazars happened to speak a language which for some reason has no turkic substrate that makes sense and to top it all off this yiddish of theirs was as if by some crazy jew magic heavily composed of hebrew and aramaic vocabulary obviously the native language of khazar khaganate the oldest non semitic words in the language are from romance latin languages which basically proves that these people came from middle east to rome and then afterwards to the north and north east in europe but in the bizarro world of khazar conspiritards it makes more sense that they came from khazaria despite all the linguistic not to mention the genetic evidence completely dispelling this myth

the largest diaspora of jews in israel are actually mizrahi and sephardic not ashkenazi the ones that were kicked out of the rest of the middle east

they are more european than they are jewish if you ask them where their x great parents were it would be europe

of course these are all rhetorical questions as the answers are astonishingly clear save the whites grave the slights where slights refer to people deemed inconsequential or inferior to others or who are seen as a slight against western expansionist plans are you suggesting that since the beginning of israel jews were considered white and not slights by europeans if so i have a bridge in brooklyn to sell you

read it and weep dude you know this kind of language isn t acceptable in the sub so you ll have to point out where in your source that ashkenazi jews are khazar converts because it doesn t say that at all

same ashkenazi in north america and often get told the same thing

the ashkenazim though are indigenous to both europe and the middle east whereas the mizrahi jews and sephardic jews are heavily connected to ancient semitic paternal and maternal ancestry also keep in mind israelis dispossess palestinians and give their lands to people who in many cases have a fair bit of slavic ancestry this included a christian bethlehem family and there is no way your average ashkenazi has close to the indigenous ancestry of a christian from bethlehem and genetic studies of ashkenazim keep emphasizing their paternal line for a good reason so yes there is some indigenous ancestry connected to years or a d c e when some people fled after bar kochba s failed rebellion against rome but it s been shown such elements objectively mixed with western central and eastern europeans in the case of ashkenazi jews partially indigenous ashkenazim are viewed as white passing unlike say the lebanese who heavily descend from the ancient canaanites who would have been similar to ancient jews sephardic and mizrahi jews far more look say the lebanese in comparison the sephardic on their maternal and paternal sides have much more west asia and north african genetic markers it s pretty obvious many ashkenazim make it seem they are the same people as bar kochba genetically when they clearly are partially indigenous to europe clear examples of are that are ariel sharon who was first defense minister then prime minister and a founder of the likud along with begin he was partially descendant of sobbotniks ukrainian orthodox christians who became jews the same was true of his friend general rafael eitan who assisted him in lebanon he also had a sobbotnik background but somehow such elements have the right to palestinian lands

ashkenazi and sephardi split around the year ce they were jews living in rome they moved to different places when the jews were kicked out of rome

lol the dna says you re wrong there were some very early converts very early and hardly any since then that s what the dna shows you should look at that article from cell i linked where do you get the idea that ashkenazis are mass murdering every last middle eastern person who isn t jewish and stealing all their homes and possessions you ve been reading that hamas propaganda again haven t you you shouldn t you know it rots your brain

again why is the racial crap of the us globalized yes racism is a global problem we have our own issues with discrimination against ethiopians here and many arab countries have their own racial hangovers from their own black slavery episodes we have all sorts of other bigotries too but the specificities of the us variant and even better that the whole rest of the world magically gets updated in sync whenever the us does what the actual heck sort of lunacy is that who cares if jews became white in the us according to some humanities department in the us that says nothing about israel or india or france or iraq the threat of having our whiteness revoked and the implication ofgenocide that comes with that revocation is part of the carrot andstick all ethnic groups face as they re absorbed into whiteness and so you just cowardly identify as white in spite of acknowledging it s imposed on you what about your own culture and your own history the maccabis are rolling around in their graves and yes if you accept their identity identity games they are your elites they d have mentally subjugated you or something like that surely you can be white from the perspective of an african american but why the hell does that need to change your worldview about your own history do you define yourself solely in terms of how others see you that is called not having an identity all i see here is a load of assimilationism which is your right but it s also my right to call it what it is and furthermore what the flying heck does it have to do with us oceans away from you

mizrahi jews seem to make up roughly half of israels jewish population and they we re from the middle east north africa and sephardi jews as well some of them were from north africa so no not most were from europe

sephardim are not white but mostly they are extremely mixed with the mizrahim

it s not inaccurate to say ashkenazi jews are from europe if you re going to make this claim everyone can then say they re african because all humans likely originated from africa the reality and it s a sad one is that i cannot trace my ancestry back to ancient israel i can trace it to europe and dna data is no more reliable for that because it gathers trends for different groups and does not actually have any scientific basis for saying that someone comes from a certain place or people just that they share a certain number of tracked characteristics

which according to something i ve once read might be the results of italians converting to judaism no or at least it s not that simple italians greeks and european jews are the result of a convergent mix of mediterranean peoples that happened during the roman republican and imperial period with jews having a stronger levantine component greeks a stronger greek and anatolian component and italians a strong italic component while yes italians and greeks might have intermarried jews the convergence went both ways as many jews would have ended up ancestors of christian families and many non jewish levantines would have intermarried italians and greeks

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-10-04 16:13:23+00:00 ---
yeah thats because ashkenazim and western jews west of the land of israel mixed with eastern mediteranean populations years ago while mizrachim are basically assyrian mesopotamian which is closer to lebanese than mixing with italians greeks north africans

white european jews jews weren t considered white nor european at the time israel was created some white passing jews have only recently begun being seen as white as seen is israel there exists a superiority of european jewry over african arab persian jews those groups are heavily discriminated against in israel not really anymore beta israel faces the most discrimination currently because they re the latest group russian groups suffered the same levels of discrimination when they immigrated and they would fall into that european jewry group

proportionality in war is a silly concept the war ends when the victor achieves its objectives or the loser surrenders whichever comes first proportionality does not enter into it

does the thought of war get you excited

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-23 22:34:23+00:00 --- ---
obviously yeah that s why every warfare should be condemned funding war and being at war is evil and should be condemned that s my whole point

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-11 23:22:37+00:00 --- ---
moral governments surrender when losing the war is imminent they surrender to save their civilian population like japan and germany that s how the world works

yes youre finallyngetting it war is hell because combatants and civilians commonly die i applaud the life you ve led since it seems you ve not only never been involved a war but for the first time you re being exposed to wars barbarity there are several conflicts nearby where x more women and children are starved or killed are you aware of this also

since october the beginning of the war obviously

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-04 17:54:18+00:00 --- ---
i might have been lied to only if i never saw the evidence there is a ton of evidence about it also my knowledge about the iraqi war isnt at par with this one but these two wars are completely different for a bucket load of reasons and for those reasons they cant be compared

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-08 08:49:13+00:00 --- ---
so i guess it s war then may the strongest most well equipped and well trained win

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-26 04:06:48+00:00 --- ---
is that because of why it was fought or how more specifically how in comparison to similar wars

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-17 13:57:00+00:00 --- ---
that s the most stupid comment i ve seen regarding this war

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-17 18:43:17+00:00 --- ---
it isn t this could very well cause a full scale war though

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-30 06:23:07+00:00 --- ---
the question is what the goal of that war is when will the objectives be fulfilled

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-19 20:45:47+00:00 --- ---
literally usa is the only country that can end the wars but their government is too connected to the very people who profit from war america s secretary for defense is literally on the board of raytheon it s a joke

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-07 10:34:44+00:00 --- ---
in my response i m not considering the details of fighting a war with hummus it s by design i m not into those details they don t concern me in this debate they re a symptom of the issue i m questioning why there s a war in the first place

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-22 17:26:40+00:00 --- ---
maybe don t start wars then

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-24 02:22:03+00:00 --- ---
i have seen people try and make this argument multiple times and it just doesn t make any goddamn sense wars have never been strictly defined by whether or not it s a conflict between opposing armies wars are just armed conflict that s really it it has nothing to do with whether or not the sides are of equal capacity colonial wars are a good example

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-25 15:41:50+00:00 --- ---
that s war for you you have ugly choices to make

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-24 02:15:06+00:00 --- ---
literally yes every war causes supply lines to be cut and resource scarcity is a reality of war zones like you re saying this sarcastically but it s factually true

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-10 10:23:09+00:00 --- ---
it s not just according me it s an indisputable fact your countries entire war effort is funded by the united states and your question will go unanswered because only a fool would give a specific timeline to when a country will collapse still with the how many weeks i gotta be honest you don t come off as an intelligent person

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-27 19:31:19+00:00 --- ---
i am not an ethicist i am a war historian war is for learning from to be better at war and facts matter

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-19 21:16:50+00:00 --- ---
and what do you propose i do about it sit down with the lunatics waging this war and politely ask them to stop i hate to break it to you but that s been tried over and over and is seeming to only make things worse what exactly is your point here please enlighten me with your wisdom and you should care about history the only way to stop things like this in the future is to keep the horrors of it fresh in everyone s minds but even that isn t all that effective the perception of the severity of it fades over time reality is real our feelings don t change that

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-05-12 12:10:27+00:00 --- ---
it s not meant to be a fair fight modern war never is a fair fight

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-11 21:07:14+00:00 --- ---
waging war and crying about the results of a war that you waged does seem a bit wrong

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-31 15:44:32+00:00 --- ---
that is not the reason the usa gives money and weapons to other conflicts that are worse you just dont care

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-08 00:43:29+00:00 --- ---
sorry to be a debbie downer guys i haven t seen the real reason for this yet wake up all of you the war machine will continue all countries involved are profiting from this bullshit they use all these reasons above y all have listed for you so you stay distracted from the money they make the history of the conflict is real but the true answer to why is profit so continue to argue over who s right and wrong and forget about the most logical purpose to any war ever it s sad because y all can t read between the double spaced lines

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-01 08:29:07+00:00 --- ---
as you say you shrug it is war it s also one you will inevitably win why upset

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-26 04:58:36+00:00 --- ---
i agree that the way they conducted the war not careful at the same time a lot of what you are describing is fantasy

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-21 06:37:17+00:00 --- ---
yes i d imagine if war doesnt happen then a territory where that war might have happened won t look like war had happened aside from that very obvious fact do you know what the word disregard means

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-03 08:23:12+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-02 15:15:33+00:00 --- ---

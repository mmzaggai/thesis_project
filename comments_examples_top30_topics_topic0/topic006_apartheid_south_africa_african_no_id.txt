that s not an accurate analogy though is it because those black people were not generally seeking the establishment of a nation state based on their ethnic or religious identity it was the south that did that as you said it was about civil rights

i d use the encyclopedia brittanica definition apartheid afrikaans apartness policy that governed relations between south africa s white minority and nonwhite majority and sanctioned racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against nonwhites the implementation of apartheid often called separate development since the s was made possible through the population registration act of which classified all south africans as either bantu all black africans coloured those of mixed race or white a fourth category asian indian and pakistani was later added

when there were boycotts protesters around the world for an end to apartheid in south africa no one asked them how it should be done or criticize them for not having a solution other than to end apartheid it s not like the protesters have any say in the matter other than to voice their opinion that it s wrong what we do have a say in is how our government and its foreign policies affect how we vote on the issues if a country wants to take foreign money and arms it opens itself up to criticism on that aid from the people in those countries

south africa was white and black and it was a white ethnostate policy and actions is what makes a state an ethnostate not ethnic makeup in a single slice of time they are not ethnostates they do not have any directly discriminatory policies directed at everyone but the primary ethnic group eventhough turkey is arguably closer to one due to their actions against the kurds also whataboutism does not help your argument at all

i didn t mean it s an apartheid state i meant the conditions under which it was established weren t the ones we d want in order for the whole project to actually be sustainable or viable or even peaceful it was established under conditions that have ultimately brought us here so if anything the conditions weren t ideal i m talking about the whole thing as a geopolitical project from a geopolitical analysis perspective

south africa s administration of namibia for one it wasn t part of south africa the presence of an oppressive system of control and discrimination is what makes something apartheid the mere fact that you are imposing this on an outside occupied territory instead of internally isn t any kind of strong defense

they believe whatever their government shoves down their throats so i m not surprised i mean that is the whole point of apartheid is to make sure the two groups of people don t get to interact and have empathy towards each other it s silent for one group while extremely violent to the other

ethnic cleansing is defined as the systematic forced removal of ethnic racial or religious groups from a given area with the intent of making the society ethnically homogeneous this process can involve direct removal such as deportation or population transfer as well as indirect methods aimed at forced migration by coercing the victim group to flee and preventing its return through methods like murder rape and property destruction

how is removing illegal settlements not ethnic cleansing you are coercing settlers out of their homes and preventing them from returning on the basis of their ethnicity i cannot think of a definition that magically makes it not ethnic cleansing just because the settlers are there illegally im not even commenting on the merits of this policy but let s call a spade a spade yeah

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-19 16:18:30+00:00 ---

you can t ethnic cleanse while feeding people are you capable of critical thought seriously all your comments in this sub seem to lack any serious consideration or thought your comment history consists of the like if genocide why haven t they been killed already if ethnic cleansing why haven t they been starved imperialism is a good thing we need more of it in war you have war crimes this is the equivalent of allowing a certain type of german supremacists a platform to speak

if the early american settlers got up and left before they started their genocide of the native americans would it have been ethnic cleansing of the settlers no obviously not it would have prevented an ethnic cleansing and genocide of the native americans i think y all should be focusing on the latter part of what i wrote and thinking of a solution to the mess you ve gotten yourselves in

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-05 02:13:48+00:00 ---
yeah i m confused how putting them in a safe place ethnic cleansing

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-06-16 18:55:22+00:00 ---
can you source this claim none of what i said was incorrect some may say that as well but this doesn t change the meaning of either expression words have meaning and when people start to change their meaning they are actually admitting that they have no valid challenge to them for example calling ethnic cleansing clearances settling

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-30 03:24:50+00:00 ---
you can call it ethnic cleansing

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-23 15:47:36+00:00 ---
ethnic cleansing can simply mean forcing people out it does not have to involve mass death

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-12 03:14:20+00:00 ---
you make a good point they should just allow roll over and accept ethnic cleansing why are you so bloodthirsty

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-06 22:14:32+00:00 ---
the relocation of refugees in a refugee camp obviously isn t ethnic cleansing because by definition refugee camps aren t permanent it wasn t ethnic cleansing for france to clear the calais jungle and relocate the refugees elsewhere

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-08 19:24:22+00:00 ---
it s not ethnic cleansing to get rid of people who want to just murder and rape i don t care if that s their cultural norm or whatever but if they re going to continue attacking and refuse to live in any sort of peace then you gotta do what you gotta do it s called consequences ethnic cleansing is removing people for their ethnicity and due to pure hatred not because those people are a constant and never ending threat with zero motivation to live in any peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-06 03:44:23+00:00 ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-13 19:13:14+00:00 ---
i would argue that once you see a large portion of the population following the orders of your enemy if you kick them out during a war that wouldn t be ethnic cleansing that s just making sure you don t get stabbed in the back while fighting for your life

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-01 23:51:42+00:00 ---

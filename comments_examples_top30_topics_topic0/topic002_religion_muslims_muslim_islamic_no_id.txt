people across the world need to understand that there is no scope for rational discussions with muslims this is pure discrimination and incorrect your statement is essentially saying that there aren t two muslims that are capable of having a rational discussion

look at what france did to algeria for over years and you ll see why some people feel the need to do what they did algeria is called the land of a million martyrs and its not because these people died invading france they died liberating their country you can t dismiss violence as senseless violence without looking at the history behind the situation the french were not motivated by religion when they colonized and massacred the algerians but they still did more damage than the algerians can ever do

this is such a lazy response and an indication that you are uneducated i understand that muslims in europe commit crimes in higher percentages but have you ever tried to get educated and asked yourself why and not just blame islam if that s the case why are the gulf countries thriving why are muslims in america also thriving and do not commit crimes nearly as much as in europe the biggest indicator of crime is poverty europe received many refugees and they are often come from very poor backgrounds and they even became more poor in europe the us has strict immigration laws and don t really allow poor people in unless you illegally crossed the border from mexico look at every country and see which demographic usually commits the most crimes it s of the time the most poor i know i probably wasted my time and i ll never change your mind but in the off chance that you are not a bigot you might do research

sure i agree to an extent but polling in various islamic countries and those with decently large muslim populations uk france shows that there is often a majority or significant minority of approval for various actions beliefs or behaviors like the us got what it deserved in and etc i think the bigger issue is with islam as opposed to an ethnic group

they are a fringe minority and they study and pray instead of serve in the military so they re likely to never act on that education

this entire post can be reduced to one word jihad that s it it s the same regressive honor based ideology the japanese had with sepukku and kamikaze bombers we all know how it reached it s end in ww unless something similar of that scale happens islamists will rather die trying to kill the khafirs than just living alongside them

this is a dilemma many of us live with for me personally i will stop believing otherwise if i see the muslim community questioning their own book religious leaders practices and push for reforms a book that actively asks that non believers be killed or forcefully converted is not one of peace the content was likely relevant for the time when it was written but no longer as long as i dont see common muslims rising up and asking the tough questions and forcing change i will continue to equate them with terrorism

here s the issue though numbers as you say billion muslims let s say are totally peaceful and are violent or support terror attacks and violence that s people let s say only of them are willing to join groups like isis or carry out attacks that s about a million people that s a harrowing thought when radical regimes are also reigning in countries like iran and afghanistan and pushing these ideologies across the muslim world it also does not help

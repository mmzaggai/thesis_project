what you re describing about a silent majority is interesting even in the protests when there s say a crazy person usually spewing some insance rhetoric it s always funny to see the awkward looking protestors behind them look down or off to the side like uhh that might be too far i ve seen this in confrontation videos where a person will walk up to the protest and start interviewing them even in these extreme protests the crazies are still find a way to separate themselves

i feel like if there are people out there protesting every day there are also probably people who are protesting on october th simply to protest more i m not saying nobody is protesting on october th because of what happened

you seriously think this is a coordinated effort to distract rather than a genuine attempt at misinformed protest holy mother you re just as delusional as they are the far left doesn t even like biden get a grip

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-06 18:30:23+00:00 --- ---
it s good that they are doing it but maybe it took them too long anyway i hope the protests grow stronger

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-26 20:58:49+00:00 --- ---
if you want to really protest something then you have to make some sacrifices

protesting feels good and thats one of the main points im not from the us and in my country people just now have started to create themselves an opinion of these subjects but oh man here people literally went to protest because our corrupt president was declared guilty and they love her the reality is that people think they are doing something they can steal and destroy while protesting and we are young and dumb to realize it

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-11 23:36:42+00:00 --- ---
to that point i think a lot of the protestors are just bullies in real life if that s the way someone acts at a protest i fear how they act around other people in their life and how they treat them

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-18 19:03:01+00:00 --- ---
why wasnt there more protestors

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-23 05:57:17+00:00 --- ---
tbh i think the people who consume and become convinced by such low effort bottom of the barrel pr should be embarrassed of themselves it s like have some self respect and challenge literally anything you are being spoon fed it hit me like a brick earlier today the white saviour complex trope is real it s being exploited to manufacture misaligned sympathy and it works very well but at the end of the day it s all moot international policy has not wavered some public statements maybe but anything tangible no is that policy going to change no for all the citizens try their protesting and boycotts are literally moot

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-08 19:05:10+00:00 --- ---
eh pushing against a private business s unethical behavior to the point of arrest is a form of protest doesn t necessarily mean he actually thought the first amendment would protect him

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-09 21:20:19+00:00 --- ---
well then you have found the extreme minority i have been on marches with thousands and saw nothing of the sort

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-14 20:41:22+00:00 --- ---
yeah i was hoping to join the global march too but i had a knee surgery and i m still in pt for months it was anticlimactic as the marchers got blocked in the airports and highways is there another plan in the making in the future

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-04 19:26:52+00:00 --- ---
because the protests are directed at the governments and agencies that support fund and arm them

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-28 23:05:22+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-06-25 05:15:31+00:00 --- ---
it s not just about schools it s about governements support the students protest where they are but of course if the rest of the population is passively collaborating it won t be enough if you want to have an any how protest can have an impact you can check out what happened during the vietnam war

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-04-15 22:02:22+00:00 --- ---
nothing about my comment indicated that i think it is perhaps i said that peaceful protestors emphasize the peaceful aspect of their resistance with a bit of derision considering another one of my accounts caught a ban for making a joke about shooting a certain oligarch into space without a space suit i m being a little more cautious about how i say things

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-03-13 00:42:31+00:00 --- ---
yes it is a logical reason to protest something you think your country is helping to occur it happens with many things regardless of the behind the scenes that s your answer take it or leave it don t make it sound like i hold the opinion of the answer i am giving

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-20 08:32:36+00:00 --- ---

who would be protesting against what and where

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-02 06:02:30+00:00 --- ---
yeah nazis social democrats ar enow nazis if a demonstration is dissolved which was clearly the case here the police has to remove you and if you do not follow police orders they will drag you out that will happen to anyone who does snot follow the rules of demonstrations it s their own fault for not following demonstrations look at the massive anti right demos here in germany these managed to follow the rules if the demo doesn t manage to follow the rules then that s just what happens in any democracy that works would also happen if it was a pro israel demo if they failed to follow regulations and then refused to comply with police orders

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-19 13:33:34+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-02 12:41:51+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-29 06:42:15+00:00 --- ---

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-10 23:06:53+00:00 --- ---
with that said i agree with inclusivity i agree with being kind to them if you see them in public but if they start protesting our rights and attacking us in public then no i will not be kind i will not just sit here and let them pull the card while they try to remove ours

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-05 17:43:29+00:00 --- ---
a protester being disruptive wow

larger maybe maybe not idk it s not yet oct th in my city according to the article you linked some were violent as well it didnt mention celebration p s i expected a bigger crowd of protesters than in front of the white house there were probably more school kids or tourists in front of the white house than protesters

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-02 06:49:40+00:00 --- ---
didn t they hold non violent protests in the past which were met with violence or at least that s what i ve read

yes the protesters are delivering that message which is good that we can t tolerate these crimes

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-11 14:30:20+00:00 --- ---
if people are protesting it s because they want their governments to react

it was a lot of things but my mom asked me if i would take them to a protest after seeing photos of what happened to al shifa hospital so i think that was the first straw

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-25 00:03:10+00:00 --- ---
i saw nothing about counter protesters yeah it s the counter protester recording and posting it lot s more on their twitter if you were not part of that group and you were trying to enter you d probably be terrified why try to enter the camp if not a part of the group to counter protest right nothing in that video was terrifying a bunch of rich college leftists larping as homeless is one of the least terrifying thing i can think of mob violence can be pretty quick to start and brutal there was no mob violence

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-27 20:13:31+00:00 --- ---
vast majority of protestors to be fair the vast majority of protestors don t understand what they are protesting for

good for you it was very brave of you to do that and kind to deliver food the reception you go speaks to the character of the protestors they aren t reasonable or willing to acknowledge that you want peace

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-24 16:03:33+00:00 --- ---
it takes two to tango what you re asking for is not realistic this is why people looking at protesters and thinking wtf your heart is in the right place but

within german law you have to announce protest before so that it can be legal these guys did not but blocked the berlin central station without announcement permission and refused to go when they were ordered they then started to take measures against the police carrying them away to demolish that demonstration and thereby forced more drastic measures these measures were announced before as is required by law to give the participants of these illegal demonstrations the opportunity to go voluntarily if you don t go after the warnings the police will use force and scenes like these occur if these people had announced it before all of this would not have happened the permission to have demonstrations is granted for everything that is not aimed against the german statehood or constitution and there have been numerous pro palestine demonstrations without anything happening in the recent past so no the caption is stupid it should rather be how people that demonstrate in a way that is not lawful and refuse to cooperate with the police are treated

we all should do this and totally agree a mass walk out would be the most effective and it would result in the least amount of people harmed at home but yes i have been protesting but will continue to support people standing up against the genocide

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-01 21:00:21+00:00 --- ---
showing your political and moral aligning in a hostile opposing environment is so incredibly brave it s easy for me in the uk to boycott and march but to openly oppose against the power you live in is truly very important

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-21 08:12:42+00:00 --- ---

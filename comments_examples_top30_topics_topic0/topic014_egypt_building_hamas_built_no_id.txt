what s your point that the tunnels into egypt are essential for everyday gazans or that they re blocked by egypt for security reasons

that s not factual israel may claim km of tunnels but gaza is km if tunnels were literally under every block it would look like a subway grid and there s no evidence of that and even if tunnels exist they re underground that doesn t justify wiping out above ground buildings or explain why the destruction so vastly outpaces the number of hamas fighters saying tunnels are everywhere is just a lazy excuse for erasing gaza s surface

i have seen the boxes in the warehouse in genoa and there were some of them covered as someone did not want to show the content i then have heard that beside food there are also other things and i think that they are objects useful maybe to build qassam rockets i think that an impartial inspection of this cargo before he reaches the port of rafah will dissipate any doubts

tunnels make it worse cause then you need a bigger bomb to collapse the tunnel

the tunnels are a fact there s nothing to believe as far as i m aware the un isn t even denying that the tunnels are there but thanks for confirming that you consider undisputed facts that cut against your narrative to be propaganda

my great uncle wrote a book published in i which he described the many tunnels under palestine they have been there since ancient times

there is only square kilometers in all of gaza do you have any idea what kilometers of tunnel would do to the ground stability let s math real quick km turns into meters multiply that by say meter average tunnel size you get square meters divide that by and you get square kilometers there is more tunnel than land at that point

the issue you have with this is that such techniques are essentially pruned out over time by the asymmetry of force and if they don t all surrender and particularly with the presence of religious fundamentalism this is sort of inevitable it of course isn t justified it s just likely to happen because if some of their forces fight from open fields wearing clear markings and some from inside civilian infrastructure all the ones who fight in the open are immediately killed and now you re fighting a force of people who only fight from civilian infrastructure that said i m not sure i understand the criticism of tunnels on their own tunnels that come out in hospitals or something sure because that s just more use of civilian infrastructure but tunnels just underground seem like the only possible way to fight from within such an environment without hiding in civilian buildings

unrelated but i wonder if they found any archaeological findings while constructing these tunnels isis did the same thing with tunnels they did find a lot

maybe you should go hide in a tunnel with your friends

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-13 15:34:41+00:00 ---
they could have the hamas spent about billion dollars on the tunnels they could have built themselvs a singapore israel only built the wall years after the pull out only in response to hamas continued terror

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-27 02:32:08+00:00 ---
haha like gaza didnt have tons of concrete to build bomb shelters they built tunnels instead

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-01-09 18:51:33+00:00 ---
the original plan was for the paratroopers to sieze the egyptian border in december to destroy the tunnels where is this info from

i suggest you expand your world view the syrian refugee crisis was worse the entire country of syria was destroyed within the last decade no outcries of genocide because it didn t fit the agenda kids die every day getting bombed they only want you to thinks it has only ever happened right now and by israel and thats because our enemies have something to gain from it the people stay in their homes in support of hamas well i ask why hamas does not let the people use the tunnels to be out of harms way

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-29 19:34:28+00:00 ---
thank you for the recap yes both of these claims are true at the same time and do not contradict each other israel built underground shelters under the hospitals and hamas built km of tunnels under gaza both have been used for military use by hamas

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-15 14:06:50+00:00 ---
yes we will ignore the miles of tunnels and entrenchments built beneath gaza city

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-22 15:50:16+00:00 ---
no i am not a hamas member but do you really think they can t tunnel into israel think about it think about the square feet of the border and the cost of building such a wall don t be so naive

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-03-27 05:24:16+00:00 ---
at the start of the war hamas was members strong close to of the adult male population between ages were hamas terrorists the hamas disease is rampant to compare hamas to a lone school shooter that can be eliminated is truly unreasonable i don t believe israel can blow up the tunnels beneath gaza without taking out the infrastructure above if they could easily do this then the tunnels would serve no benefit to hamas

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-17 14:38:46+00:00 ---
a they don t have to submerge the tunnels in order to make life for the terrorists a lot more miserable than it already is b they don t have to fully submerge the tunnels to put the fear of god into the terrorists and make them surrender

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-19 11:38:54+00:00 ---
it s an actual historical fact that there are tunnels under al shifa if teh only proof you will accept is with your eyes go buy a plane ticket and see for youself via con dios

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-15 07:12:46+00:00 ---
show me proof that they did build the tunnel then

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-09-28 02:32:28+00:00 ---
sorry were you under the impression that hamas build all those tunnels to shelter the civilians in and israel was just blowing tunnels up willy nilly and that s why civilians were killed

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-23 10:30:10+00:00 ---
booby traps have been found in schools and public buildings as well hamas tunnels have been found under these buildings that s why they were targeted why should they not be able to built many traps they built a complex military defense tunnel network unique to history this shows that they are not stupid nor lack capabilities resources or funding how should israel get to the tunnels effectively if not by the way they are doing now if they want to clear out gaza for settlements why destroy the houses and infrastructure there that would be counter productive if you wish to settle there

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-16 18:53:12+00:00 ---
targeted controlled airstrikes and sending commandos into the tunnels

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-24 21:52:49+00:00 ---
keywords tunnels civilian sites this means that bunker arent built under civilians sites civilian sites are the designation for the complex at large not the civilian buildings which israel nevertheless bombed

shocked by the amount of money stolen from the palestinian population when we see the tunnel network built instead of improving civilians lives i just want to share a point about the tunnel network that i don t see well understood enough the original beginning of the tunnel network wasn t created by hamas after the beginning of the israeli blockade of gaza following hamas election the first tunnels were created by palestinians as a way to circumvent the blockade and smuggle in goods and supplies to sell these tunnels quickly became an essential part of the gazan economy made the people operating them quite wealthy and hamas recognised their importance and came in to take over collecting taxes extortion from anyone using the tunnels then they also recognised the military potential in such a network and began expanding it for that purpose i m not saying this to defend hamas who obviously have prioritised their military preparations activities over providing for the people of gaza but it s not like they drained the economy to build tunnels the economy was dependent on the tunnels because of the blockade

there was that news story a couple years back when egypt pumped gas into one of the tunnels and it killed a couple palestinians i think it was this one i saw i read that on reddit and did some further research into the tunnel system that apparently runs underneath the border and various news stories i found said a good chunk of them are in rafah and date back to the s or s

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-13 23:44:06+00:00 ---
lol if people cant come up from tunnels and someone floods it it is the people in the tunnels faults if they are flooded from both sides potentially good thinking

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-19 09:54:48+00:00 ---
they wouldn t even allow construction equipment i wonder why that could possibly be terror tunnels anyone

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-20 11:56:23+00:00 ---
nah gas is too inefficient and the effect dissipates without harming their equipment water damage is more devastating for men and materiel it also prevents access to the tunnels

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-26 02:43:23+00:00 ---
can t prove against it either so i don t know why you stand with yamas who built those tunnels bennesth all hospitals and schools don t distract and prove your claim

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-24 21:54:38+00:00 ---
what s the difference between a bunker and a tunnel in regards to hamas usage

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-03-27 23:54:32+00:00 ---
i meant one or two hell even eight hamas fighters being in a school is equivalent to being a school shooter since they are both carrying weapon with the intent to hurt people you clearly have no idea what you re talking about here the tunnels are much easier for hamas to move around than above where an israeli drone is watching them below it is strategically better for them since it s easier to move and harder to be spot once again israel could absolutely blow up the tunnel without blowing up the building above in fact they did this in every war those buildings got destroyed by air strikes the reason they didn t blow up the tunnels is because it s where the hostages are

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-14 01:45:07+00:00 ---
israel has to find the tunnels and show the world or end the war you re smoking the really good shit this war wasn t started because of tunnels under a hospital and won t end if there s no tunnels under this hospital

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-14 21:51:07+00:00 ---
try and use civil language if youre mad go and take a breath to calm down and come back sure there are militants in gaza we know that the question is if they are hiding in hospitals so far the only publicly available proof is a video of an idf soldier pointing at baby bottles and blankets saying they must belong to hostages these are very normal things to find in hospitals how did this even pass as an argument is beyond my imagination if people dodnt already believe the claim that is being made and a small cache of perfectly laid out weapons the hole in the ground showed could be anything lots of hospitals have underground levels for generators and other infrastructure its not necessarily the entrance to a tunnel

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-15 14:50:29+00:00 ---
this is nothing new everyone knows hamas has tunnels all over sensitive areas in gaza they themselves have admitted it it is the sick news media that is suddenly playing ignorant to milk the situation as much as possible they did the same thing with titan submersible when it was obvious passengers were dead fake news media instead went on a ridiculous oxygen countdown

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-21 14:49:29+00:00 ---
they probably have special forces undercover in there already and they re trying to find the targets tunnels and then they will bring in the force

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-08 20:30:09+00:00 ---
the whole area is razed because israel is taking out the structures that hamas is shooting at them from they re taking out the tunnels too but that takes longer if your quarry goes to ground leave no ground to go to it would be nice if hamas came out in the open to be picked off or even if they d hide only in structures and send the civilians out instead of hiding behind them war s gotta go on either way or there will be a second war later

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-24 22:56:20+00:00 ---
hamas builds military tunnels instead of bomb shelters they dismantle civilian infrastructure like water pipes in order to make weapons the most well funded refugees in the world have bad infrastructure because they are governed by a death cult if that s the first time you ve heard these things you are probably living in an echo chamber netayahu is terrible not everyone who disagrees with you is blindly pro israel

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-09-01 15:42:41+00:00 ---
have you seen the tunnels

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-20 18:57:03+00:00 ---
before you ask why israel built single institution in that area maybe ask why hamas built tunnels under every inch of gaza

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-02-26 20:40:05+00:00 ---
if only hamas gave civilians access to these huge tunnels they built

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-28 05:53:01+00:00 ---
they put the tunnels directly underneath where they all live not much of an option going into the tunnels man by man would be a suicide mission

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-10 12:15:40+00:00 ---
they refused to build bomb shelters this has always pissed me off because they have no problem building tunnels it s such a prime example on how they re an occupying terrorist organization and not a legitimate government

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-10-23 05:36:49+00:00 ---
so the existence of tunnels isn t surprising or relevant it is if hamas is using them

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-05-18 10:04:45+00:00 ---
they have robots that can walk through tunnels

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-02-21 01:17:27+00:00 ---
even if it s true they didn t wander into those tunnels by themselves every death is hamas fault no exceptions

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-11 12:08:52+00:00 ---
even with superior force and technology there is none that can deal with tunnels without civilian casualties there is no magic homing bullet that can recognise and kill just terrorist it is foolhardy to send special forces to a certain death fighting in a tunnel that can be rigged full of traps

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-23 06:21:14+00:00 ---
how are they going to operate a rail without electricity what kind of kinetic power can they produce successfully underground for such a distance a strap attached to a hamster like object with a hamas terrorist running inside

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-24 21:20:55+00:00 ---
oh so what s you exactly idea to go in those tunnels underneath and hunt because they don t know the landscape and hunting means dead hostages and dead army

being racist is not the same as being fascist what do you mean they mimic the economic model to the letter which letter fascism famously doesn t have a cohesive economic model different fascist states had wildly different economic philosophies each individual fascist state might even have a completely different economic model from one year to the next depending on its needs there is no fascist foundational economic text like wealth of nations for capitalism or das kapital for communism that was accepted by fascist states their only unifier was opposition to both liberal capitalism and communism i don t see the us as being hostile to liberal capitalism for example

it s not though the kind of mindless compliance on display in this video is exactly how those movements picked up steam you can t have fascism without a mob that does things without question that s very clearly what s depicted in this video people repeating and endorsing what a stranger says without even knowing what he s going to say and immediately complying with his interactions without question or hesitation

all i see in this post is the blatant lack of empathy and the justification of everyone but us is our enemy which are just the number one trademark of fascism being afraid of what happened on oct and the consequences for your fellow citizens and loved ones is normal using this to as you put it yourself crush an entire population under your boot is not

a point and parallel i forgot to mention and have just thought of and a way to better explain my perspective is that and i hope you can look past the inflammatory nature of the group i m suggesting and take it in genuine jest is the fascists initially under mussolini and some of the earlier nazi s there was a lot of subscription to socialist policy but ultimately we saw the implementation and ends of fascism as extreme right wing and see it as nothing else but right wing a century down the line

oh come on all european states have a clearly anti fascist stance at least publicly even spain which endured its dictatorship until the s is now very democratic as for militarization the problem was the cold war with the arms race of course if nato had been dissolved like the warsaw pact perhaps we could have begun a serious race toward demilitarization but instead bush sr and his successors chose to keep it as a convenient tool despite its anti soviet usefulness having expired and so yes we are highly militarized the point is we shouldn t officially we don t have any dominant ideologies commercially speaking capitalism is geared toward expansion but in theory it shouldn t be forced by force

yea but the terrorist organization he led plo an umbrella organization for terrorist organizations was responsible for scores of acts of terrorism from its creation resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians the plo murdered israeli athletes at the munich olympics murdered schoolchildren at ma alot in murdered people and wounded of by attacking an israeli tourist buses along the haifa tel aviv coastal highway in hijacked the achille lauro cruise ship in and murdered a disabled american jewish passenger the plo also launched terrorist and guerrilla attacks against israel from jordan until they were ousted by king hussein in september and more terrorist attacks from lebanon until they were ousted by israel in i don t believe for minute that he spent the better part of his carrer attacking israel by any means necessary including launching civil wars in both jordan and lebanon but actually intended to live peacefully with jews when it was all over that idea doesn t even make rational sense

they did speak about creating their own state why do you think the plo was created in

i would love to see your source on when palestinians accepted a state solution and reconized israel the plo had to formally recognize israel as a part of the oslo accords though of course hamas is not the plo

the pa was founded by arafat and is currently led by abbas the plo was founded by arafat and is currently led by abbas ergo the pa is the plo the plo has committed a number of attacks against israeli civilians

but generally the plo is nowhere near as radical as hamas and my point was that the comment about plo was vague to begin with nothing on whether they are good bad etc plus it s not like the plo themselves are calling you those things you re also on the internet where people will call you any and everything under the sun at least once don t let comments such as being called a child mulcher get to you unless you are one lmao in all seriousness though my original point was more about stereotypically associations people have for example i m palestinian and yeah i hate netanyahu personally for his policy against us but it s not like ima go after every jewish person i see because of it people make the typical hamas palestinian bad and israel jewish bad kind of associations all the time it only proves one thing that the person saying it is stupid lol

the plo was an arab nationalist movement thats the entire point it was never about palestinian nationalism aside from some early christian arabs and local jews and minorities for the most part it was never a palestinian national movement it was an arab nationalist movement and by arab nationalist i mean muslim supremacist arab nationalist arafat was egyptian arafat and abbas were trained by the kgb the plo funded by the kgb pan arabism under nasser did not care about a palestinian state the majority of those talking about a secular palestine prior to were jews and christians

interestingly the original plo charter gives up any claim to gaza and the west bank with the palestinians saying it actually belongs to egypt and jordan

of course they don t deny it it s the declared objective the two largest parties hamas and plo have been in agreement about this objective all along in plo has every advantage experience in governing better negotiation power with israel but all the rest was roughly same except hamas was much more violent within gaza and in their promises about fire and blood whereas plo who invented the fire and blood had made that temporarily a secondary method and focused more on parliamentary legal means who won the elections and why

--- subreddit: Palestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-10-08 08:54:30+00:00 ---
i think the real issue here is that hamas is not the plo and that s the question he really didn t like it s being posited that he and abbas are kept in their positions by israel and if hamas does take control of everything that s not going to end well either he had no answer to this because it s really a weak spot politically even worse hamas likely wants the blowback and division it helps them politically

nelson mandela was pro palestinian freedom shortly after his release mandela then made it clear he was committed to ending apartheid and establishing majority rule and rights for all in south africa when asked about his relationship with the palestine liberation organization plo during a town hall meeting in the us broadcast by the abc channel he reiterated his support for the group who then were still regarded as a terrorist organisation by the us and israel we identify with the plo because just like ourselves they are fighting for the right of self determination he said arafat is a comrade in arms and we treat him as such in a speech on the international day of solidarity with the palestinian people mandela reaffirmed his support for palestinian rights we know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the palestinians

was a typo the plo didn t exist until i am aware of the camp david summit thank you for being a shining example of the attitude of both us and israeli expansionist governments any terms offered by us israel are assumed to be reasonable and any failure in negotiations is purely the fault of the native americans palestinians

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-13 10:16:01+00:00 ---
even if that was true how does that negate the essentially terrorist nature of plo and other palestinian factions

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-05-29 19:08:18+00:00 ---
the plo fatah officially recognized israel in but their most sacrosanct demand in all negotiations since then has been the right of return which is a call for israel to let in millions of descendants of refugees into israel proper in essence they recognize the existence of the state of israel but they do not accept its continued existence as the nation state of the jewish people

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-01-10 15:52:15+00:00 ---
the plo did that already

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-12-30 18:13:47+00:00 ---
plo accepted a two state solution in plo became the pa so they are the legitimate authority even though israel undermines its authority and does not allow it to govern effectively hamas showed willingness in bibi has gone on the record stating that it is in israel interest for hamas to run gaza because if pa runs gaza it will show legitimacy of the pa

the plo was considered a terrorist group in the s they literally chased arafat out of the region invading occupying lebanon in the process resulting in people dying in lebanon dead people radicalizes people like i said nothing ever happens in a vacuum if palestinians hate israelis because they are jewish it s because of its conflation with israel the state that killed people in lebanon israel is the jewish state the state that resulted in villages destroyed in resulting in the displacement of palestinians resulting in resistance movements popping up and then this and then that and then this and then that see where i m going with this

the charter of the likud came more than a decade after the phrase was popularized by the plo in their call to eradicate israel and it s inhabitants for the establishment of a palestinian state

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-04-05 13:41:23+00:00 ---
lol plo recognized israel s right to exist renounced armed struggle and is doing security arrangements with israel until this very day israel took of historical palestine on the of what was left they offered a state in which they want to keep permanent settlments keep permanent israeli military bases deny airspace ocontrol for palestinians and want to control border between palestinne and jordan maybe in israel s head they think they offered a state but in the real world this is not a state this is legalised occupation

the palestinian authority and plo never actually recognized israel when it came down to ratifying it in the palestinian legislation they never upheld even the most basic element of the oslo agreement regardless according to the palestinian constitution palestine is an islamic state

again the us designated the plo as a terrorist organisation in an action you claimed would mean forfeiting its ability to participate in any meditating role during future negotiations six years later arafat rabin and clinton were shaking hands in front of the white house with the us in the undisputed meditating role pointing out that negotiations the way you define them existed both before and throughout that time and despite that designation isn t as helpful to your argument as you seem to think

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-08-26 16:03:07+00:00 ---
the palestinian leadership isn t that the plo haven t they agreed to peace with israel for a long time now

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2021-06-10 09:10:19+00:00 ---
i m saying that was the official position of the plo you said that the plo was never public about their position which is not true

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-07-31 18:31:40+00:00 ---
plo was also a resistance militia back in the day they formed years before the war and declared the liberation of palestine as their stated goal while at the same time not contesting jordan or egypt s occupations of the west bank and gaza

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-14 04:23:28+00:00 ---
neither the pa nor hamas recognizes israel as a state the plo did for a short time and revoked that shortly after

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-13 04:04:33+00:00 ---
this is the plo we re talking about founded in it initially sought to establish an arab state over the entire territory of the former mandatory palestine advocating the elimination of the state of israel however in the plo recognized israeli sovereignty with the oslo i accord and now only seeks arab statehood in the palestinian territories the west bank and the gaza strip that have been militarily occupied by israel since the arab israeli war originally they meant to eliminate all of israel the same plo group that s considered a terrorist group fatah the most notable of what were considered terrorist acts committed by member organizations of the plo were the avivim school bus massacre by the democratic front for the liberation of palestine dflp killed nine children three adults and crippled in the late s and early s the popular front for the liberation of palestine the second largest plo faction after al fatah carried out a number of attacks and plane hijackings mostly directed at israel most infamously the dawson s field hijackings which precipitated the black september crisis in the black september organization carried out the munich massacre of israeli olympic athletes in members of the dflp seized a school in israel and killed a total of students and adults and wounded over in the ma alot massacre the savoy hotel hostage situation killing hostages and soldiers carried out by fatah the coastal road massacre killing israelis and wounding also carried out by fatah

and the pla didn t agree to anything cause they were already planning the second intifada

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2023-11-10 22:08:38+00:00 ---
not really israel needs one party to negotiate with for palestinians the plo is the obvious choice because they are already running the west bank gaza on it s own creates a big unknown where groups like hamas can grow the plo is far from perfect but you can t build a government in gaza from scratch

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2024-03-10 00:04:02+00:00 ---
when the plo was formed it was made up of people who were violently ethnically cleansed in order to make israel they formed the group years after the state of israel was establish they used violent armed resistance in order to destroy israel initially arab states tried to destroy israel on the behalf of the palestinians but it s not as innocent as israel makes it out to be they say they declared independence and out of no where arab countries declared war but israel was ethnically cleansing palestinians way before they declared independence they were jewish terrorist groups called the irgun lehi and haganah who were going around ethnically cleansing arabs and in they attacked egypt and jordan first in a preemptive strike israel destroyed egypts airport and fighter planes and took over the gaza strip west bank sinai east jerusalem and the golan heights after being left to fend for themselves the plo decided to go the guerrilla warfare way a lot of it were attacks on civilians like the munich massacre hijacking of planes eventually the plo recognized israel and decided to put down their weapons however israel never halted their plans of expanding their borders they have a vested interest in the west bank because it was a part of their ancient kingdom they also propped up hamas to destroy the plo to be fair israel has made multiple attempts to have peace with the palestinians but the palestinian leaders weren t willing to compromise and that is how we have the problems we have today

why wouldn t israel agree to the right of return for palestinians at the oslo accords that was the road to peace with the plo

--- subreddit: IsraelPalestine | kind: comment | dt: 2025-08-31 21:53:18+00:00 ---
no i m sorry but that s incorrect just read the plo charter to see for yourself the plo charter clearly called for a single democratic state across all of historic palestine where muslims christians and jews would live with equal rights this vision was integrative and respectful toward jews while remaining firmly anti colonial also palestinians are not synonymous with all arabs i kindly remind you that the plo was often critical of other arab states as well what you re doing is a fallacy of generalization the error lies in assuming that what is true for some members of a group automatically applies to all members of the group

the plo had approximately two dozen terrorist organizations operating under their authority during oslo so unsure where you learned that they were pacifist

in the palestine liberation organization plo moved its headquarters to lebanon and began raids into northern israel during this same period the plo was a pivotal reason behind the precipitation of the civil war in lebanon for instance in lebanon s muslims and leftists supported the plo and sought more political power its christians seeking to maintain their political dominance opposed the plo the factions fought fiercely through early and lebanon became effectively partitioned with the christians in power in the north and the muslims in the south

you should be complaining to your elected officials that they don t do enough to combat terrorism given the stupidity of the obama administration in empowering the muslim supremacists in iran to basically fund their proxies unchecked the plo is what set the palestinian cause back decades the plo is as much a terrorist organization as hamas but they wear suits instead of keffiyehs they literally destroyed lebanon with their antics they rejected multiple attempts at peace hamas is actually an easier problem than the plo because hamas doesn t justify its jihadism and extremism it s proud of being a muslim supremacist movement the plo is a sin of a movement unprincipled power hungry arafatist and pro hamas when push comes to shove no offense to you but that comment is in very poor taste

us occupation didnt end after japan disarmed the us occupied japan for years and months after they surrendered before hamas even existed the plo offered peace agreements broadly along the lines of international consensus no it didnt require israel to take in millions of palestinians refugees and israel refused this included the plo completely renouncing terrorism ect during the taba talks the plo also offered a completely demilitarized state under israeli occupation but israel broke off the talks israel instead opted for continual land theft of private property which is illegal even in contexts of conquering territory in a war so israel opted to keep the war going if the us had opted to continue takingjapanese land to build us settlements on the war would never have ended either

israel is the one that backed up from that the plo was all for palestinian state they were very open about giving israel the rest of the land and still have been popular among the palestinan public them peddling back from that just doesn t make any sense

the plo represents palestine they became the pa just because they made up afterwards doesn t mitigate the risk their historic actions represent no nation wants to be couped because they took in a class of permanent refugees

the plo never tried peace the plo should have been forced to surrender unconditionally

the palestinians were idiots for voting hamas into power and it was idiotic of israel to finance hamas to destroy the plo

the plo was created to annihilate israel there was no movement for self determination or for palestinians to remove themselves from egyptian rule

there will never be and hasn t since the plo which was a corrupt and weak entity the intention sadly of the placement of the palestinian peoples in gaza was a cruel one with iran leading the way iran has far too much money and influence in infiltrating a weakened arab people to ever let a free palestinian exist the goal has never been this by those truly at war here and let s be clear this is about iran battling israel

israel didn t refuse plo refused and started the second intifada the khartoum resolution remember try again

i generally agree however i still think peace between israel and plo is not realistic first of all you re giving the plo way too much credit yes they are not a terror organization in but let s not forget the plo did start as a terrorist organization and was the catalyst to both the jordanian and lebanese civil wars even in abbas is paying families of terrorists to encourage palestinians to kill israelis the fact that this is considered moderate just goes to show how insane hamas is bibi and hamas neep to go they are definitely the ones making the most problems but abbas has also proved he is not a partner for peace he can keep the status quo with minimal damage but he won t do peace arafat tried but even he couldn t do peace in a time when israel was dominated by the left rabin peres barak at the end of the day some things like jerusalem and hebron are just deal breakers for both sides regardless of who their leader is at the time

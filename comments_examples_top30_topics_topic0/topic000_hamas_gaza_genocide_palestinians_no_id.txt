um palestine was never a nation state it was an area under turkish rule the turks lost in ww living somewhere does not make you a sovereign nation the british and the french carved up the middle east lebanon was created by the french in the same way israel was created by the british the local population was offered a country alongside israel they turned down the offer in the hopes they could expel the jews they have been trying to do this for the last years a few countries have gotten smart and realized israel isnt going anywhere jordan egypt if they don t see this as a good option that is their right keep fighting keep losing or get smart and kick out the jihadists and come to the table maybe that will work but this certainly is not i have no idea what apartheid you are referring to west bank arabs palastinians are under the authority of the pa not israel s fault they haven t held elections in years

hamas or not they were armed in civilian apartments in civilian buildings in a civilian neighborhood that is a valid military target my point is that hamas not only uses physical human shields but also in the media

as i said in all other conflicts the data published by hamas were in agreement with the ones that were published by israel so yes the world trusts them they will be verified by the israel after the war also k dead women and children and i ask you what if they are correct how would you feel because the numbers are correct as they were in the last conflicts you understand that the whole world accept the data and condemns the way the war is fought right only israel and it s boss the usa are fine with it maybe it is you that are brainwashed and not that world is against you maybe you are the same as with germans in ww where they thought that the whole world are wrong and they were the correct ones

zionisim as an ideology did two things in history creation of a jewish majority state in the region of palestine the expulsion of k palestinan civlian from their homes continuous stateless situation imposed on them i think those who lost their homes because of zionisim have the right to be anti that ideology which expelled them keeps them stateless don t you think

and the land proposed for the jewish state under unga had a jewish majority just as the land proposed for the arab state where the huge majority of arabs in the mandate had been living for generations had an arab majority because they gerrymandered palestine to hell and back in favor of the jewish partition of jews fell into the palestinian partition while of palestinians fell under the jewish partition neither group probably wanted to be under the others rule regardless of guarantees of equal rights the wrench in the gears is because of that population distribution the palestinian partition with a population would need to absorb a population of while for the jews they would be absorbing a population of into the palestinian portion would simply have no way to manage that kind of population transfer homes infrastructure jobs for people that is going to be a toughie jews migrating are going to have a choice of the lot because now tens of thousands of former palestinian homes have been vacated the whole thing was just bonkers have you seen the map they drew up

yes moses only physically killed twice according to your source but the torah itself indicates that he did massacre women and children via his soldiers he said according to deuteronomy at that time we captured all his towns and in each town we utterly destroyed men women and children we left not a single survivor and there is no proof that muhammad committed rape the sources mention he asked saffiya to marry him and she accepted if that is what you are talking about

it s a bad situation made worse by the fact that arabs reject a two state solution that doesn t conform to pre boundaries which israel will never approve and jews won t accept a one state solution without some form of arab disenfranchisement because they would rapidly become a minority within the country and that will inevitably lead to more slaughter the real solution requires surrounding arab states to take responsibility and support the palestinians many of whom are actually from neighboring arab states

it s almost as if the pp gang has an agenda with why they don t want to talk about sudan or syrian genocides or maybe they don t like the comparison to what a real active genocide looks like because it would show the world how the israelis are doing it wrong

why post pictures of missing israelis in places outside of israel how will posting a poster in new york city help someone be found in gaza it seems illogical the posters are being posted outside of israel to raise awareness and not everyone kidnapped by hamas is israeli they are holding hostages from a variety of countries including about a dozen americans tearing down the posters indicates you don t care about the hostages who are predominately jewish

from the river to the sea was co opted by hamas and took on a new meaning with the help of israel saying it meant to kill jewish people but the original meaning of the phrase is actually just freedom and human rights

the average person in gaza is neither a diplomat nor reasonably informed and he is likely ignorant of the hostage situation

genuine question for everyone is a genocide based on the percent of population or how many are killed appreciate opinions thank you

argue with the doctrine and letter of the convention if you can seems to me like you can t refute his actual argument so you re nitpicking about details irrelevant to the charge of genocide

thanks for compiling this there have been several debates regarding the ultimate aim of the bds x b bds is not cult and doesn t follow the opinions of one man the ultimate aims of bds are laid out in it s website so this is all one rather large red herring when you say charter what are you referring too x b secondly it is only right not just to look at partial quotes but rather the full quote and in it full context so take the first one x b definitely most definitely we oppose a jewish state in any part of palestine no palestinian rational palestinian not a sell out palestinian would ever accept a jewish state in palestine the first thing to notice is that he isn t speaking on behalf of a bds supporter but on behalf or a palestinian the second thing is to see the full quote the one where he says he opposes a jewish state just as he does a christian state and a muslim state as he does support exclsuive states instead he supports a state where all are equal x b sites and haters who are fighting a losing propaganda war don t want context and dont want his actual views fully understood

all of these countries pretend to be democracies north korea is literally called the democratic republic of korea so that s clearly not it you either have to admit israel is a democracy and then you need to explain why is targeted more than far worse countries and for that matter other democracies or you can claim it s just another middle eastern dictatorship that merely claims to be a democracy and then you need to explain why is targeted vastly more than any other of these dictatorships including other us allies this they pretend to be a democracy nonsense is an expression of anti israeli cognitive dissonance you want to both justify uniquely high standards for israel so you can attack it but you don t want to admit it s deserving of high standards just like the anti israelis who refuse to admit israel is a real state but believe should follow the rules that apply exclusively to states you can t have both

the amount of people here saying it s fake news is concerning the claim that hamdan ballal was throwing stones has been refuted by all major newspapers including the new york times and here is a video showing israeli settlers throwing rocks at activists in the west bank in the area where hamdan ballal was assaulted obviously not victims and unlike the palestinians they are fully armed in addition to the rock throwing anyway ballal has been released though visibly beaten

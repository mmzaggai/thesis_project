have you heard the news but who owns what you re hearing and reading we need to know i prefer knowing whom to hold accountable when i read news especially when trying to ensure democracy prevails so i built an index actually three how many news outlets are in america which one should you trust read usatoday com you might be able to figure something out by reading this article the reality is that news is controlled by what people want to hear some people just want to come home and drink their beer they don t want to hear bad news because some of them already had a bad day at work news time is based on ratings and ratings determines what people want to hear

throughout history jewish is an ethnicity as well as a religion there are different ethnic groups that fall under the umbrella of judaism but genetically speaking they all share the same roots factoring in for converts as well of course there are religious jews who aren t ethnically jewish but that doesn t mean that jewish isn t an ethnicity as well it means that it is both the canaanites are somewhat irrelevant as both palestinian arabs and jewish ethnic groups have genetic markers that point back to the canaanites jews were persecuted in europe for years it doesn t weaken their claim to a need for a homeland it strengthens it by proving the necessity of it yeah it was the occupying ottoman turks who were overthrown palestine was part of ottoman syria and the whole reason for the various mandates was to re establish peaceful governance in the region that doesn t change the fact that the jews have a historical connection to the land just because the empire that was overthrown wasn t the empire that overthrew them doesn t change the fact that there was a power vacuum that needed to be filled and a large number of zionists who were prepared to fight for it if they had to it s not like the jews militarily invaded the land they did it through avenues that at the time were largely seen as legal im not talking about the mutual violence here i m talking about immigrating to the country and purchasing land now these methods are sketchy by modern standards inhumane even considering the claims that the people selling the land were not the people living on the land jerusalem has such a complicated and not well understood history and yeah colonisation is a thing of the past tell that to russia who are currently annexing parts of ukraine arab colonisation has stopped largely because it was forced back i m all for the demilitarisation of israel provided the rest of the region is demilitarised as well trouble is with iran giving support to war faring regimes across the region removing support from israel would potentially result in the most brutal war the world has ever seen the proof of this was october th that level of inhumane brutality simply cannot coexist peacefully with the rest of humanity like it or not we re all here together israel understands this the arab world does not', 'heres what you don t understand about zionism zionism is the self determination of the jewish people and the belief that they should have their country in their ancestral homeland that is it period it s a plural movement anyone whether jewish or not can be a zionist if you support a ss congrats you are also a zionist that also means that yes there are people from the left people from the right secular religious atheists moderates and unfortunately extremists i don t need to accept that some zionists support extremism it s a reality the same way that there are feminists that are extremists and perpetuate hate against men it s a reality the same way that there are people in the pro palestine movement that celebrate hamas and terrorist groups although i understand your point about the idf id like to remind you that the settlers just recently also attacked some idf barracks because they were protecting palestinians so as much as the idf has big big problems i wouldn t generalize and say it is a policy but what i can agree is that ben gvir commands in way that do try to protect violent actions from settlers but it s so not the monolith you think it is just this week the chief of staff of the idf said he was going to resign if netanyahu would move with the annexation of gaza so again yes the idf has problems just about as many as any other military in the world but it s also not a monolith they don t all agree or think the same so i don t agree that it s a policy i can t say what others are doing but please go on instagram and look for standing together movement or combatants for peace i m not israeli have never set foot in israel so there s really nothing i can do the only thing i can do is talk and condemn what i don t agree with but those two movements are examples of movements that are on israeli grounds doing grassroots work again what is your point you aim to prove that all zionists are bad because some of them support violence but i bet you don t like when people say that all gazans are terrorists which i don t agree by the way i m using it as an example so if it s not correct to collectively judge and apply guilt to a group of people based on the actions of some extremists why do you think it s correct to do it when it comes to zionists', 'you can t functionally move forward if dna and direct personal ancient lineage is the basis of citizenship i agree with you about the irrelevance of the indigenous train of thought we are where we are today personally i think there needs to be attention on efforts to put jerusalem under the governance of an independent council that reflects the religions that view jerusalem as a holy city and is chosen not only by local residents but also at the global level by faith communities be it religious leaders a rotating system of leadership these are policies and details to be explored after agreeing there s merit to removing jerusalem from the possession of palestinians and jews and christians have the council report to the un and have the un fund road cleaning and sanitation there is no point in arguing whose religion is more important and has more sacred tie to jerusalem all three religions have historic genuinely expressed beliefs that see jerusalem as holy i m happy to assume that all three faiths claim to the holy land are due to theology we cannot say who is right because any direct hand knowledge happens when you are dead from there maybe a two state solution could work this conflict would be a war of conquest like other wars of conquest in history back and forth fighting over the same land is not unfamiliar israel must exist palestinians are never going to get lives land community taken during the nakba back perhaps the conversation should shift to acknowledging that the founding of israel wasn t without malicious actions and violence towards people living in villages who were alarmed their lives would be negatively impacted by the creation of a nation that didn t recognize their connection to their home the state of israel was founded as jewish homeland that is naturally going to feel threatening and not good to people living there who are not jewish doesn t matter if this new nation says it s tolerant of all religions it s still a new manufactured political state that asserts one religion has superior citizenship than others the right to return is honestly painful for many in the palestinian diaspora who wish to take elderly parents and grandparents back to the villages of their birth before they die settler colonialism may not make sense to your parents that s fine but can you see how well intended religiously tolerant pro israel people might still see how settler colonization is relevant i want to understand how well meaning ordinary people with the best intentions see the world so differently i want to humanize people nobody should be telling anybody to leave the challenge is how to have both palestinians and israelis see that they both have valid attachments to this part of the world nobody has a relevant moral or theological argument that should weigh on coexistence when you call for jews to leave you are ignoring the fact that this part of the world has always from moses day been home to different religious groups expelling jews is not only wrong and on the face abhorrent but it minimizes any claim that palestinians want to make about why they have a claim to the land i got no answers but deep in my heart believe that the way that both israelis and palestinians talk about a homeland needs to change and include both jews and palestinian people of all faiths who believe that they should be able to live in their homes otherwise how is this going to end get rid of hamas by blowing up innocent civilians the killing of babies shooting of women in a church the shooting of people holding up white flags you tell me how another islamic terrorist group isn t going to appear and target jews because they think jews are targeting them']"

genocidal executions of people the bulk of the town s adult male muslim population of the kind you saw the palestinians carry out on oct th and the idf hasn t carried out at any point since and yes those are the reason it s genocide and not any other transfer in the yugoslav wars the transfers alone were at most further evidence of the intent behind the executions not sufficient for genocide as the same icty pointed out in the staki case it does not suffice to deport a group or a part of a group a clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group the expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide as kre has stated t his is true even if the expulsion can be characterised as a tendency to the dissolution of the group taking the form of its fragmentation or assimilation this is because the dissolution of the group is not to be equated with physical destruction in this context the chamber recalls that a proposal by syria in the sixth committee to include i mposing measures intended to oblige members of a group to abandon their homes in order to escape the threat of subsequent ill treatment as a separate sub paragraph of article ii of the convention against genocide was rejected by twenty nine votes to five with eight abstentions if you believe it s a myth that genocides always include close range executions death camps and the like name one universally recognized genocide that didn t include close range executions at the very least i get that there are academics who decided that the us carried out genocide against the germans and the japanese in ww against the north koreans in the korean war the vietnamese in the vietnam war and so on but the genocides that we all can agree are genocides be it the armenian genocide the holocaust srebrenica darfur rwanda the isis genocide of the yazidis all included mass close range executions and if you want to limit it to the law it s even more limited the only two genocides that were judged by international tribunals included those close range systematic executions and not even all close range executions mind you sure the genocide convention could be theoretically more broad but the way the icty and ictr and specifically icj interpreted it was very clearly not and if you want to talk about evidentiary standards the bar for inferring genocidal intent from pattern of behavior that requires genocidal intent to be the sole reasonable inference more or less demands something of that sort the icj in the south african case found at most that there s a plausible future risk of genocide for the palestinians not that israeli officials statements actually prove that any idf action was done with genocidal intent preventing return after displacement makes it illegal forcible transfer of population not ethnic cleansing a term that has no clear definition unless it s done for a legal reason like legitimate and proportional security needs yes i don t think i said otherwise urban warfare by its nature essentially always includes systemic and predictable civilian harm systemic and predictable civilian harm is not by itself even illegal as long as proportionality and distinction are observed let alone inherently genocidal and many if not all wars include dehumanizing language from at least some of the participants to some extent or another if only by the actual soldiers on the ground and often well beyond that and while not every war includes everything you said there were absolutely wars that included more destruction expulsion of far more people far more brutal sieges etc and are not considered genocide the only thing you could argue here is that gaza is a tiny area so if we pretend it s its own country not even part of palestine the destruction is very large as a percentage of that country but if that s the argument then the thing lead to that destruction and expulsions the scope of civilian enmeshment the massive war machine built exclusively under and inside people s homes mosques hospitals and schools militarizing the overwhelming majority of the built up area in the strip is not just the biggest in history it s several orders of magnitude worse than any other examples incidentally the human animals is part of the lies that south africa has been telling you to the point i even wrote a post about it at the time you re not making a good point when you quote that part or other parts of the ludicrous sa arguments like amalek and so on isn t making your case stronger it shows you re relying on bad information', 'here s the us holocaust memorial museums definition genocide is an internationally recognized crime where acts are committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group these acts fall into five categories killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group forcibly transferring children of the group to another group there are a number of other serious violent crimes that do not fall under the specific definition of genocide they include crimes against humanity war crimes ethnic cleansing and mass killing', 'in the present convention convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide article ii genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group forcibly transferring

extremely black and white this is not a military state there s so many people here are you seriously trying to claim all of us every single one no exception is part of a us army in the middle east that our hopes and dreams don t matter yes israel does have financial backing from the us for the purposes of buying weapons but there s a huge difference between that and saying the entirety of israel is just one giant us military offshoot also uh dunno if you knew this but a lot of computing parts and so on are made and invented in israel just go look at wikipedia for the list of inventions by israelis there s a lot one common for example is cherry tomatoes we created those same for innovations in agriculture at large mobileye which is used in plenty of vehicles these days developed here in israel intel chips which are used in a ton of computers the world over also made here true we don t have an israeli car brand we tried some odd decades ago iirc or some huge name anyone would know but all the brands and devices you do use most likely take something from us so maybe let s not talk in black and white if you want to claim that our government is beholden to what the us wants militarily sure that s a reasonable claim but to claim the entire purpose of our entire country is just to be a us army offshoot is a bit much wouldn t you agree heck i m a game designer i make video games i m a private dev no one employing me not yet anyway is that also part of the us army', 'israel survives only through unconditional american support this is where you lost me i don t think you realize how independent israel truly is even militarily without us support it would still be a pretty formidable opponent compared to it s local enemies israel has become far more self sustainable over the last few decades compared to its infancy and so the removal of us support while it would be a huge blow would not be catastrophic israel has other allies it could lean on to replace that void some of whom are america s enemies this is a big reason why israeli support continues politically smart politicians know they d rather be allies with israel rather than israel become allies with america s competitors however if the us went from being an ally to being an enemy instead of neutral then you would be more correct economic sanctions would hurt israel pretty badly but it would also hurt the us as israel exports both significant goods and knowledge to the us obviously the prospects of the us turning on israel militarily are slim to none so i m not even entertaining that idea you must at least recognize that there is an existential threat there there will be a reckoning also disagree i doubt this will be so cataclysmic as you think iran can barely do anything and neither can any of israel s surrounding neighbours even without us or european support israel can and will continue to survive if places like iran north korea and others can continue to exist just fine doing what they do so will israel i m not defending any of israel s actions here but it isn t the end times for israel just yet', 'aside from some money spent on tech like the iron dome which involves data sharing with the us and is data which the us is extremely interested in collecting and having access to for the most part all the money given to israel is spent on us produced military hardware the us funding accounts for about of israeli military spending and or more of the us funding is on us products just as a quick overview israel and the us is working jointly to develop other systems of interception such as high power modern laser interdiction systems which may actually allow the israelis in the future to actually ignore attempted rocket salvos since the low cost of laser interdiction may end up with a cost analysis where the destruction of incoming munitions costs the rocket producers more than the defense compared to the current arrangement which is about times more costly for israel which is one of many reasons the us provides funding to the israelis it s literally a program of funding the continued military superiority of israel which the us does to make it possible for israel to avoid feeling the need to make use of temporary military supremacy in order to end the war with neighboring enemies before that temporary edge is lost to unforeseen future circumstances it s quite literally the us paying the israelis to chill this started during the cold war when one of the highest tension moments between the us and the ussr was during the yom kippur war the israeli willingness to work with us conflict de escalation attempts and their economic suffering following the opec oil embargoes placed the us in a position where they increasingly valued

it is possible for many people to get lost in the weeds and not take in a text as a whole you re welcome i agree that it s easy to miss the context with these verses and i can t blame the people who do if i were them reading the violent verses without knowing the first thing that i d think probably wouldn t be if i had all the historical context i m wondering if you could elaborate upon something that i ve heard about as it seems that your image quotes one is al tabari a hadith from what i understand the qur an is law and the hadith s are kind of up to each believer as in people who are muslim must agree with the qur an but don t necessarily have to believe the hadith s i do plan on visiting a mosque locally in my city and this is one of the questions i would plan to ask i do need to first google what practices to observe when visiting al tabari is a tafsir tafsirs are basically stuff that is written to explain verses in the qur an from what i understand the qur an is law and the hadith s are kind of up to each believer as in people who are muslim must agree with the qur an but don t necessarily have to believe the hadith s well we believe that the qur an is the holy book of guidance sent by god whereas the hadiths are man made recordings of the life of prophet muhammed pbuh both are necessary of course for example muslims pray to god five times a day the thing is the qu ran doesn t say that it s only the hadiths that say we have to pray five times a day so they are both very necessary for muslims for the second part where muslims don t necessarily have to believe in the hadiths well that depends the thing with the qur an is that it is one book that we believe has never changed since it was first made so we know to follow that but with hadiths there are thousands of hadiths and not all of them are credible some are weak some are inauthentic etc so with hadiths we need to make sure its the correct one whereas with the qur an we don t need to worry about that also the hadiths mostly tell what is sunnah things that the prophet did that we can also do but that s optional etc anyway yeah to us the qur an is pretty much superior than the hadith the only ones who don t follow the hadith whatsoever are qur anists but the qur anists belief that only the qur an should be followed and not the hadith is an incorrect belief and there is a lot of evidence supporting this i do plan on visiting a mosque locally in my city and this is one of the questions i would plan to ask i do need to first google what practices to observe when visiting i can refute criticisms of islam well but yeah a mosque would be the better place to ask for questions like this about the hadith the practices to observe when visiting well i probably don t know everything that i would recommend you to do but here s some instead of saying hi or hello say assalaam allaykum it s arabic for peace be upon you and it s how we greet people call men brother and women sister it s more respectful in islam and maybe more that i can t think of yeah probably better to just google it for context i believe i originally came across this when listening to a muslim speak on the age of consent and that apparently depending on which texts followers choose to believe the number can be different i don t think there is an age of consent in islam but i m not sure you could probably ask on it though', 'i studied islam for this exact reason i don t think anyone should have any opinion on anything unless they know what they re talking about i didn t want to not know islam is so complex to understand islam you have to understand muhammed his life the language barrier the intentionally incorrect translations to english and the law of abrogation saying islam is a violent ideology is not an accusation it is simply fact to deny this is a denial of reality even within the laws towards muslims it s legal to beat your wife and execute muslims who do not pray five times a day or renounce the religion or insult or question the prophet or say there is no god it s oppressive and violent for everyone not just non believers it does happen to be an ideology that teaches war there is an entire book dedicated to war in the islamic holy scriptures war is a huge part of it s ideology and frankly it s how it got so big and powerful in the first place we all can study any subject we want and as long as we study it with an open mind i think it s fair to comment on it and offer my take on it muslims can disagree but i just i know i m correct so it doesn t matter also hard to have any conversation with muslims about islam because again it s taught to them and also legal for them to lie about their religion so they can say anything they want they can lie with impunity is not the same but i see the similarities the iraq and afganistan wars were revenge there was a long history with both of those countries though and iraq was pretty much like it probably needed to happen and the reasons were bullshit yes but we knew he has wmd because we gave them to him he just used it all to murder a hundred thousand kurdish men women and children sure i can see this invasion is revenge idk what were the options really allow terrorists to dictate law and have demands met through violence and intimidation is that really an answer either which is worse do you think which would teach people that terrorism gets you the results you want the bigger and worse the terror attack the better the capitulation that s a really bad lesson to teach people in the end i think it s far better to give people a lesson that it doesn t work and won t be answered with demands met and next time you want to do that know what s coming which they did because it s happened many times in the past by now if israel didn t order evacuations and tell people to leave the area that is going to be bombed and invaded i would agree with you but at this point the people that stay are fully aware they are risking their lives and i place the blame on them it s ironic because everyone thinks the jews don t have to fight and for some unknown reason the palestinians get this full pass to fight almost like they have to fight they hold zero responsibility for what has happened for their kids dying because they don t leave and follow orders because they want to fight more than they want their children to live it really is the biggest hypocrisy no matter which way you look at it', 'the west doesn t think it s core values are in line with radical islam as much as they don t think it s in line with radical christianity and certainly not radical extremist judaism as a muslim living in the west i believe that western nations have every right to take a stance against any and every extremist idea intolerance can t be tolerated especially in a society with a great variety of different people living next to each other which is the case in many western countries speaking about islam one has to ask itself what islam and radical islam and mild islam are about the reason for most of the reactionist attitudes among the people in the middle east towards the west is not religiously motivated it s because the west implemented foreign policies for the sake of their economic oil gas etc and trade interests which wrecked havoc on middle eastern soil no one can deny this by know moving on to your question how should islam as a religion be seen in the west now and in the future i think that my religion islam is perfectly in line with western core values here is why i grew up in the netherlands and have as a muslim every right as every other citizen in the nl most importantly the freedom of religion in islam there is no compulsion in religion you can t force anyone to become muslim because the hearts of people are in the hands of allah muslims believe see holy quran and so these two principles freedom of religion and no compulsion in islam are in the basis the ingredients for a tolerant relation between western nations and muslims however and this is the most important point there are people who totally don t like the idea of islam becoming a part of western nations trying to take advantage of every opportunity and doing their best to create and mobilize negative vibes towards muslims people who feel pressured and threatened by muslims who follow the rules of their religion pray and basically just live their belief are either very ignorant of islam and the prophet muhammed pbuh or they are uncertain and unsure about their own way of living beliefs and values furthermore if i believe my religion has a lot to add to other people s lives and i want to share information with others because of this reason and i m not forcing anyone to do anything everyone has the right to choose the way they believe without other people being disturbed there is a lot more to this but summing up for know islam is perfectly in line with western values and muslims have every ingredient in their religion to peacefully live in a western society among western people together with western people']"

just taken from people my family has been here since and indians were here then and i don t believe indians were moved off any land so that europeans could have the land if some indians showed up with a valid claim to the land i live on i would come to some type of settlement a settlement that satisfied them the united states did the indians wrong no doubt since then the united states has done things to help right that wrong we did those indians horribly but we have worked to make it right and we have made it right to the extent that indians are maybe the friendliest people in the united states i was in oklahoma recently on a reservation and the indians were extremely nice to me and these were cherokee indians who lived in this area they were forced to march to oklahoma i think that was by andrew jackson the land was underpopulated before we got here when we got here we carried diseases that killed off of the indian population i have read geronimo s autobiography geronimo had been packed off to a reservation oklahoma and he was well satisfied with the way he was treated he could communicate directly with teddy roosevelt whenever he wanted to and they did communicate geronimo was a war chief not the chief of the tribe geronimo made war against americans and he was very much admired some behaviors of the americans such as how they treated defeated armies well and they did not rape or kill any women or children he believed that he was always treated well i could not get any grip on whether he would have rather stayed in arizona roosevelt gave geronimo permission to write his autobiography and roosevelt read it before publication and did not change anything geronimo dedicated his autobiography to the chief of a great people theodore roosevelt would sinwar have dedicated his autobiography to netanyahu']"

defensive whatsoever they claimed an act of war was committed against them but slim to none historians agree this is the case it is completely illegal to seize territory of another country as a result of a war you started this is the reason why israel was forced to return sinai to egypt israel withdrew its troops and settlers from gaza but has continuously occupied the gaza strip since if this is not the case then why does every government in the entire international community including the usa up until the current administration say that israel occupies gaza the fact that you believe israel has genuinely offered peace over the course of this conflict or is genuinely interested in achieving any peaceful resolution is very telling it shows you have not been paying attention to whats been going on over the past years the reason why israel is responded to with terrorism is because of the terrorism it inflicts on the civilians it pretends to be offering peace to an offer for peace by returning land that was illegally occupied for decades and in the case of gaza continues to be under israeli occupation to this day it is so unspeakably shameful that people will say that israel ended the occupation because it withdrew troops and settlers although i do believe most israelis genuinely believe such a falsehood because they live under a massive propaganda machine why does virtually the entire international community consider gaza to be under israeli occupation if what you say is true', 'yes indeed the gaza populations didn t grow during the war but the only reason for so is due to the refugees fleeing gaza k the births k births x k deaths which may have been inflated it also includes natural deaths maybe have gone down but they are still high as regarding the famine yes the situation isn t the best it is a war zone the people there are in poor condition however israel is the biggest provider of aid and resources to the gazan population due mostly to israel the deaths by hunger have been low as of now in israel demolished all of its settlements in gaza and retreated all military personnel in hamas took power in the gaza strip a branch of a terrorist organization which pledged the destruction of the jewish nation so israel together with egypt initiated a blockage of gaza which has been legitimazed in the un as you may see in the palmer s un report israel did however allow most of the trade and flow of goods into gaza allowing even gazans to work within its nation regarding the broken truces the same must and can be said about hamas the west bank isn t even close to being an apartheid state first of all in contrast to the south african apartheid state israel does not discriminate between ethnicity as for all israeli citizens who are of arab origin have all the same rights as israeli jews have second of all palestinians living in the pa are not israeli citizens nor do they wish to become they have their own laws and own exclusive administration palestinian arabs are allowed to freely move beetwen zones a and b which are most of the urban lands some may argue that zone c is bigger but it is important to remember that first of all zone c is of jewish majority second it has the least population density and quantity third it constitue most of the border regions therefore are of vital strategic importance to israel palestinians also work in israeli companies and travel between both of the regions and all of the zones although palestinians have to request permission to enter zone c they are usually able to do so as long as they don t have any terrorist records and the final straw in the bucket is that the palestinian agreed to most of the territories divisions i really think the main problem with all of this matter is that people try to simplify or even think that such problems are simple while in reality it is really really complex and dense both sides have commited atrocities but that doesn t mean one side is the good guys and the other is the evil guys guess what humans are greys most of them do both good things and bad things in the end we are not perfect', 'first of all idea that anyone in gaza chose to be palestinian is simply untrue no one in gaza chose to be palestinian any more than someone in ireland chose to be irish or someone in poland chose to be polish which is to say that people are born into their national and ethnic identities even if they weren t what is someone who was born in gaza supposed to be it s not like they can become israeli citizens nor do they have a legal pathway to citizenship elsewhere next the idea that nobody forces people to live in palestine is not only factually wrong but the implication is also deeply disturbing this is a weird lie considering how forcefully palestinians are prevented from leaving most gazans are stateless and hold only palestinian authority travel documents which many countries don t accept for visas or entry without recognized citizenship moving abroad permanently is extremely difficult even if they did have passports the exits are tightly controlled egypt controls the southern crossing and does not let people pass freely and israel controls all of gaza s airspace coastline and all other land crossings if a gazan does leave there s no guarantee they ll be permitted to return to their home even for family emergencies because israel and egypt control re entry even if a gazan did manage to leave the implication that their very presence in gaza justifies bigotry against them is deeply disturbing it treats their displacement as a reasonable solution rather than recognizing it as the central injustice of the conflict next you suggest that all palestinians have an exterminationist ideology have you looked at polling from gaza which shows that the vast majority of them do not want to exterminate israel the same cannot be said of israelis of whom support the forced displacement of palestinians from gaza according to a recent poll from haaretz even hamas has accepted israel s defacto right to exist but even if it hadn t palestinians are not synonymous with hamas just as jews are not synonymous with the israeli government reducing an entire ethnic group to a political position is the textbook definition of bigotry and then finally there s your nazi jew analogy which i m still not sure i understand it seems like you re trying to say well if palestinians want to destroy israel then it s fine to dehumanize them just like it would have been fine for jews to dehumanize nazis in wwii but it s really not the same being palestinian is an ethnic national identity you are born into while being a nazi is an ideology you can join or leave like i mentioned there is no monolithic political movement in palestine millions of palestinians have nothing to do with hamas or armed resistance also equating palestinians with nazis assumes every member of the group shares a single genocidal intent that s the same logic antisemites have historically used against jews and then lastly your analogy is wrong bc you need to be for real about who is actually persecuting who here in wwii jews were the powerless targeted minority and nazis were the state perpetrators of genocide in your analogy palestinians are the stateless militarily occupied population so if anything they re closer to the jews in that historical relationship than to the nazis']"

nazis did i don t think so you seem to believe that a genocide can only fit this description but in fact the legal definition is far broader than that no it s not far broader than that the legal definition requires a specific intent to biologically destroy a protected group in whole or in part so yes they do need to have a specific intent for complete extermination of the palestinians in gaza or a part that is substantial to their biological survival e g the entire male population if there s no intent to physically destroy a protected group there s simply no genocide beyond the legal considerations i used this term to qualify the very real destructive intent toward pakestinian identity and society the gov seeks to destroy all possibility of life in gaza to destroy institutions and the entire social fabric of course it wants to destroy institutions of an enemy that has a singular desire to eliminate them and a social fabric that s deeply embedded with said enemy the allies in ww destroyed german and japanese institutions entire social fabric in wars against their entire societies while killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and burning multiple cities to the ground they did not commit a genocide even the most gentle kinds of serious wars like the iraq war where the goal was not merely to not target the civilian population according to ihl rules but to make friends with them and be greeted as liberators by no means the default obvious or legally required case was still about destroying institutions and to some extent social fabric which was deeply embedded with baath arguing that destroying institutions makes a genocide doesn t just go beyond legal considerations it goes beyond any reasonable definition of genocide full stop as for destroying all possibility of life in gaza as i said the very existence of the ghf undermines this thesis not supports it but even if we just conclude that the goal here is to make gaza unlivable in order to expel the palestinians to somewhere else it means it s not genocidal intent the law is very clear on this the icty and icj ruled that actual close range massacres not merely bulldozing buildings are not genocide because they were aimed to expel rather than destroy to this day most israelis do not recognize the palestinian plight as a legitimate aspiration that s a pretty wild argument do you think any of israel s enemies throughout its entire history recognized the plight of the jewish people and their legitimate aspirations to a state or for that matter their even more legitimate aspiration to not have their existing state eliminated and its jewish population subjugated expelled or exterminated the actual palestinian aspiration and the root cause of the palestinian plight does that mean that every war israel has fought not just oct th and not just against the palestinians was actually a genocide against the israeli jews when snipers systematically shoot children in the head this goes beyond simple war crimes it s not clear it s even war crimes at all let alone it being systematic a word that doesn t just mean happened multiple times or even committed by idf soldiers to begin with but let s assume for a moment that the idf high command ordered snipers to shoot dozens of innocent palestinian children in the head that would be a war crime and a crime against humanity of murder it would not even be the crime of extermination let alone genocide genocide doesn t mean war crimes that are exceptionally cruel anymore than it means wars that disrupt institutions and social structures again if israel actually had genocidal intent it would not be risking its soldiers lives to snipe at a few dozen random palestinian children or to use live fire for crowd control it would be carrying out the kinds of mass close range executions we ve seen in all the actual genocides including oct th we would at least see the israelis actually doing what they were accused for months of doing and firebombing the mawasi refugee area or simply starving all the gazans to death israel had the means and the opportunity to destroy the gazans for over a year and a half the fact it didn t do it shows it simply doesn t have the intent', 'i m sorry to hear about the strain in your friendship especially over such a complex and emotionally charged issue like the israel palestine conflict the conversation you had with your friend about the use of the term genocide to describe israel s actions in palestine particularly in gaza is reflective of the deep divisions and strong emotions this topic evokes when it comes to the term genocide it s crucial to understand its definition and the context in which it s being applied the united nations genocide convention defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group in the context of israel and palestine your friend s perspective seems to be that the actions of israel especially in gaza fit this definition this viewpoint is often grounded in the significant power imbalance between israel and palestine with israel possessing more military and economic power the impact of this imbalance is profoundly felt in gaza where israeli military operations have resulted in considerable civilian casualties and widespread destruction of infrastructure this severe impact on the civilian population coupled with policies that some argue aim to systematically undermine the palestinian presence and rights in the region can lead to the perception that these actions constitute an attempt to destroy at least in part the palestinian group furthermore the context of an asymmetrical conflict where one side has overwhelming military superiority is also a crucial aspect of this perspective the argument here is that the disproportionate impact on palestinian civilians the blockade of gaza and the ongoing occupation and settlement expansion in the west bank are indicative of a policy that goes beyond mere military objectives or self defense the high civilian death toll the destruction of homes and vital infrastructure and the long term psychological and physical impact on the palestinian population are seen as evidence supporting the claim of genocide on the other hand when considering hamas and its actions against israel it s important to differentiate between acts of violence or terrorism and genocide while hamas has indeed launched rocket attacks against israeli cities and espoused rhetoric that is hostile to israel these actions although part of a violent conflict are typically not regarded as genocide by most international experts and bodies this is primarily because the group lacks both the intent and the capability to physically destroy the israeli population in whole or in part which is a key component of the legal definition of genocide in your conversation when discussing whether hamas s actions could be considered genocide your friend pointed out that the scale of israeli casualties caused by hamas is too small and that hamas would never be successful in completely destroying israel this argument highlights the importance of intent and capability in the legal definition of genocide the intent to destroy a group as well as the capability to do so are both critical elements in constituting a genocide under international law it s clear that both you and your friend have strong differing views on this matter in such emotionally charged debates it s not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed or to need space as your friend did the complexity of the israel palestine conflict often means that even well intentioned discussions can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings', 'the definition of genocide is the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group there are many prominent figures repeating again and again that israel is committing genocide it s actually disgraceful it s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last years that no one cares about or even knows of let me explain why the genocide claims are not true israel has no stated intention of committing genocide the genocidal statements of some israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention they re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way approximately palestinians have died since and most of the deaths have been during war periods this averages out to about per year for reference the nazis killed about million jews per year between and the palestinian population has gone up x since and the gazan population has doubled since israel have gaza back in if they were hell bent on genocide why would they do that israel supplies gaza with free water and electricity until recently a very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide israel provides palestinians with jobs and income another peculiar thing to do if one s intent is to commit genocide israel has tried to offer the palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over a very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people israel provides humanitarian aid to gazans furthermore israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in gaza in the s and s to prop it up and promote health services weird for a genocidal country to do that death toll genocide yes understanding plus gazans have died is not evidence of genocide you must understand why and how they have died did america commit genocide against the japanese iraqis afghans and germans did england commit genocide against the germans turks and italians no of course not they were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life that is not evidence of genocide yes i m sure you can point to a few people in the israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the palestine issue and you can also point to bad apples in the idf who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it however this is not evidence of genocide you actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide i m also referring to raz segal owen jones and norman finkelstein their claims are ridiculous especially coming from university professors and i urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like']"

donations gathered by the un and international humanitarian groups who usually buy the food in the west bank jordan or abroad and transport it through israel to gaza according to humanitarian sources the idf does not allow the supplies to be properly secured before trucks leave kerem shalom to enter the areas where starving gazans live sources in gaza report that idf soldiers rush aid workers to load cargo quickly then trucks are often delayed for hours and forced to take dangerous routes because the food isn t securely tied down it s easy to steal and most of the aid entering gaza is looted on the way some food also spills due to severe road damage for months the un and humanitarian aid groups have pleaded with the idf to allow food to enter through other crossings to give them time to secure and protect shipments and to use safer routes to ensure aid reaches those in need their requests have been repeatedly denied this is just one of many obstacles that israel places in the way of feeding gaza s residents and stopping the hunger crisis on the surface there is a puzzling gap between israel s repeated claims of increasing food supplies to gaza and the ongoing daily reports of deaths from starvation and severe malnutrition especially among children obstacles imposed by israel diaspora affairs minister amichai chikli has blocked dozens of organizations attempting to deliver aid police have failed to provide the necessary escort for trucks crossing from the jordanian border the idf delays trucks at the kerem shalom crossing and limits loading times which impacts drivers ability to secure the cargo the kerem shalom crossing is closed on fridays and saturdays aid workers and international volunteers are not permitted to enter gaza through kerem shalom at the same time as the trucks the idf has established checkpoints within gaza that impede the movement of trucks gaza s social order is rapidly deteriorating because many police officers have been targeted by the idf unrwa s activities are being disrupted restrictions persist on the entry of certain medical supplies and foods the reason is that humanitarian organizations and un agencies including the world food program unicef the world health organization and dozens more have been unable to rebuild the food distribution network that operated in gaza before the current crisis began on march at that time israel closed the border crossings for days entirely causing the network to collapse', 'on the common argument that israel is using starvation as a means of committing genocide while there have been periods where israel has restricted the amount of aid entering gaza they have still facilitated over million tons of aid since the start of the war the reason aid flows have varied significantly is due to israel being influenced by ceasefire negotiations various military operations shifting border policies and logistical constraints currently the only part of gaza where famine has been declared is in gaza city a km stretch of land note that the gaza strip is km in its entirety in northern gaza that is outside of the designated humanitarian zones where it remains a major combat zone due to hamas still retaining control over significant areas especially civilian populated neighborhoods israel has just launched operation gideon s chariots ii four days ago to advance into this area a famine is classified using the integrated food security phase classification ipc when at least of households face extreme food insecurity acute malnutrition in children exceeds and the death rate surpasses two people per per day due to starvation or related causes with gaza s population of over million this would mean at least dead each day for it to be classed as a famine in the whole strip in almost years of fighting the estimated number of dead due to starvation is currently just over half the number required per day to declare a famine for a famine to be declared by the ipc in gaza city independent media investigations show that the ipc lowered the malnutrition threshold from to and shifted its measurement method from the standard weight and height indicators to the less precise mid upper arm circumference muac metric as mentioned in the footnotes of the report they also withdrew the death toll requirement mentioned above the reason this was done was due to an assumption that the number of those dead from starvation is vastly higher than reported however recent scientific studies done on this that take into account non violent deaths alongside the gaza ministry of health s reliability while using the same capture recapture method used by others such as in the often quoted lancet study do not reflect this as the vast majority of estimated deaths as of june according to the publication referenced prior are from violence as opposed to starvation dehydration or disease so just to summarise israel has in fact facilitated large amounts of aid into gaza where israel retains some level of control famine has not been declared famine has only been declared in a localised area where israel lacks control and where hamas still retains de facto governance and control the ipc changed the metrics in order to declare famine in this localised area this declaration is now being used to claim that there is famine in gaza to apply political pressure on israel while playing into the narrative that all of gaza is starving by means of misleading language therefore the presence of famine can be explained as a distribution problem due to hamas s continued actions and refusal to surrender whereby they are intentionally misappropriating humanitarian aid while allowing the people who they still hold control over to starve in order to apply political pressure aka lawfare on israel meanwhile international organisations such as the ipc have been influenced by politicisation through which they have applied an eased methodology with little transparency of doing so edit comments and days later yet not a single person has challenged anything i wrote just insults being thrown with practically every rule broken multiple times let me make some things clear to those who think i am justifying or denying that there is starvation nothing in my post suggests this to those who think i am in approval of israel s conduct nothing in my post suggests this to those who think that i am saying that the amount of aid entering gaza is sufficient nothing in my post suggests this my post is about the declaration of famine and genocide nothing else never believe that anti semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies they know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge but they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words the anti semites have the right to play they even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of

check out my other post i am always up for a discussion or debate', 'your post is dripping with sarcasm and outrage at this moment there are current global conflicts with more casualties and more displaced than the israel gaza war but fine you ve chosen this one as your hill to die on so the problem is that hamas has stolen the food and aid that has gone in to gaza previously stolen from the civilian population stolen food and medicine from starving children that need it this has made it challenging to get food to the people that need it you may or may not know that the palestinian peace advocate ahmed fouad alkhatib recommended parachuting aid in because it was harder to intercept which israel and other countries were doing i don t blame you for being concerned when i googled whether

face hunger crisis as aid blockade nears two months bbc news gaza mass starvation warning the strangest thing is that israel is expected to deliver food to its enemy as if england delivered food to the germans in ww in any event there is a story days ago about idf planning major shift in gaza aid delivery in bid to thwart hamas diversion the plan is that international organizations and private security contractors will hand out boxes of food to individual gazan families the whole sale distribution of food wasn t working because it was all being stolen by the criminally unethical hamas and its palestinian supporters in the new plan each family will have a designated representative tasked with reaching a security zone in southern gaza where aid will be distributed each box will have enough food to last several days then the family representatives return to the security zone to receive the next parcel israel believes this method will make it harder for hamas to divert aid to its fighters interestingly now qatar and egypt are supporting an initiative calling for days of calm that would see the release of the remaining israeli captives in exchange for allowing food and shelter i m hopeful and i hope you are as well that hamas will accept this qatar egypt plan they have been prolonging a lot of suffering so people like you can blame israel for all of it according to the deal

used to have jews now they have and can t even practice their faith publicly where are the jews of lebanon now at one time egypt had jewish residents now there are literally jews in the entire country where did the jews of egypt go at one time algeria had jews now there s where are their jews tunisia had jews now there s idk where d they go libya had jews now they don t have a single one in iraq

the jews of uzbekistan now iran once had jews now there are which is pretty decent but still only of what there once was where d their jews go hint the answer is not they all voluntarily peaced out i could keep going but it won t matter to people whose minds are already made up i fully expect this comment will get downvoted to hell i usually avoid posting in this sub because it s just really

thank you for writing this post it did my heart good to see it', 'it s hard to reply when you start saying for those who truly believe israel has done little to nothing wrong because even being pro israel if you are trying to use logic and not passion or irrational arguments it s impossible to deny that israel has done a lot of things wrong and the secondary part is also ignoring so many other facts but none of them makes me believe that i should be like the mainstream pro palestine because none of their arguments are logical and shows a complete use of emotion and lack of understanding of history or even point out history from years ago and an attempt to erase history and reset by not having israel to exist in the present at all this is so absurd that i cannot ever agree with this main pro palestine view to specify i was always pro israel and indifferent to palestine having studied more about the conflict made me even more pro israel and more pro palestine at the same time i can be very critical of israel and its government decisions while also holding palestinian government accountable both pa and hamas while at the same time i want both people to exist in security and with dignity any other logic different than that it s immoral to me which is why i will never support the mainstream pro palestine movement oh by the way the main pro palestine movement loves to claim that even palestinians and gazans who are moderate and have a similar view to mine as paid zios hasbarah traitor how can i ever support people who can t listen to palestinians or gazans just because they don t agree with them so i guess this should answer your question for moral clarity i cannot and will not ever support the mainstream pro palestine movement when and if they stop asking for the erasure of jewish people and israel and stop using zio as a slur and start going towards peace i will give them a chance otherwise i will stay as far away as possible from them']"

accordingly the journalists filed skeptical reports for instance new york times reporters were escorted through war zones in southern gaza after an invasion when areas had been cleared of hamas

basement and a couple ak s scattered about what s the big deal they wrote where s the smoking gun here the strategic reality before them was missed because they were not inclined to think about such

came out more zionist just watched a minute lecture by anti zionist rabbi yaakov shapiro and i actually learned a lot no sorry pro palestine i didn t come out of it less of a zionist but i do understand better how people arrive at anti zionism while telling themselves it has nothing to do with antisemitism shapiro s main claim is this judaism is only a religion nothing more according to him jews aren t a people or a nation just individuals obligated to mitzvot in his view once we stop fulfilling those commandments our identity disappears israel therefore isn t a continuation of jewish tradition it s a replacement for it a national identity invented to secularize and normalize the jew that s his argument and i kind of agreed with some of it he cited quotes from early zionist thinkers some of which are downright horrifying calling diaspora jews parasites weaklings even shameful there s no denying that many of zionism s early architects were desperate to escape the stereotype of the ghetto jew and create a new jewish archetype muscular militant sovereign it wasn t pretty it was in part a reaction to centuries of humiliation but here s the contradiction that shapiro and anti zionists in general never quite resolve they reject jewish peoplehood but they exclusively speak about jews as a collective when it comes to criticizing israel they claim zionism is political not religious but then accuse israel of corrupting judaism they say israel doesn t represent the jewish people while simultaneously demanding that jews worldwide answer for israel s actions it s a dance of denial erasing peoplehood when it s inconvenient then weaponizing it when it s useful and it misses something deeper for the average zionist like me the belief isn t that jews deserve a state because we re better it s that every jewish story whether in morocco ukraine iraq germany or ethiopia ended the same way and then they turned on us zionism didn t erase judaism it gave it political teeth it said your torah doesn t need to be studied in exile forever your prayers don t have to rise up from someone else s basement you don t need to ask the pope or the czar or the king for permission to live yes some early zionists said awful things yes zionism was messy arrogant and sometimes wildly misguided but even in all their ideological chaos they built the one thing that every other jewish survival strategy failed to produce sovereignty we re not always at our best when we run the show we ve made mistakes but at least we have a show to run so no i m not disillusioned i m more resolved and i m grateful i watched the video it reminded me of something important zionism isn t perfect but it was never meant to be it was just meant to give jews one place on earth where our safety wasn t up for debate where our future wasn t outsourced where our story didn t have to end with and then they turned on us', 'people don t know what zionism means and it s ruining like of the discourse people don t know what zionism is and that s really scary and yes the meaning of this word is incredibly important i see a lot of people claiming to be antizionist while not being antisemitic and i don t think people understand what antizionism means at all the contemporary definition ever since the creation of israel in the preservation of the existence of the jewish state that s it if you think israel should be on a map and then you are a zionist the contemporary definition of anti zionism ever since the creation of israel in is the negation of the definition of zionism which would be the end of the existence of the jewish state if you think something should happen that dissolves the state of israel then you are an anti zionist that s the extent of the word zionism it has nothing to do with the settlements or with the executive office and yes i m aware that settlers are zionists but guess what the palestinian israeli citizens that had to flee hamas and were taken in and naturalized by israel are also zionists the druze and the christians the secular people and the muslims in israel all are zionists with the obvious exceptions of radical anarchist individuals in every society even the adl knows anti zionism has been bastardized into a antisemitic dogwhistle and is now being used by people who simply oppose netanyahu unaware of the word s definition if you ve wondered why you ve been called antisemitic for calling yourself antizionist thinking it means i oppose israel s military but i still think israel should exist then you are in fact a zionist which isnt a bad thing you ve just been gaslit or misinformed into thinking zionism jews when they re bad this is the most important takeaway from from the adl anti zionism is distinct from criticism of the policies or actions of the government of israel or critiques of specific policies of the pre state zionist movement in that it attacks the foundational legitimacy of jewish statehood zionism pro settlements zionism pro netanyahu zionism pro jews anti zionism pro hamas anti zionism pro jewish diaspora anti zionism anti jew if anyone is wondering i am a progressive and i m making this post because i see so many misled progressives and leftists siding with hamas putting antizionist in their bios without understanding how horrible it is calling for federal aid to hamas

actions opposes the settlements opposes the occupation supports liberal values and equality within israel and so on and so on and no they don t accept being anti zionists they d be appalled if you told them they re merely the moderate wing of anti zionism as opposed to the more extreme wing along with hamas khamenei or assad or more precisely think you re a right wing blowhard the equivalent of american who thinks that anyone who opposed trump is on the same spectrum of anti americanness as bin laden iran and north korea as for the icj and the un a few problems with your arguments neither of them identify as anti zionist organizations the icj s decision has nothing to do with anti zionism if anything it was a liberal zionist decision strongly based on the two state formula that the jewish community in the area of the british mandate of palestine has the right of self determination and that israel is a legitimate state with legitimate borders it s just that those borders don t pass on along the separation barrier something israel doesn t even officially disagree with the un was only openly anti zionist between and and yes the arab countries who authored resolution openly believed israel should be destroyed some of them actively pursued that goal militarily their supporters in the communist and rd world bloc weren t all actively pursuing it but wanted to please the anti zionist arab states and wouldn t mind if they achieved their anti zionist goal of eliminating israel and notably resolution is one of the few resolutions actually repealed the un hasn t been an openly anti zionist organization for the past thirty years no the un s political whims don t determine what zionism and anti zionism are no idea what gave you that idea as for every person on earth being anti zionist by nature because international law rejects the current essence of israel it s absolute nonsense from the standpoint of international law saying israel shouldn t build settlements or the infrastructure to support them isn t rejecting the current essence of israel the vast majority of people on earth don t care or even know about international law many actively oppose it few think it s something that should define their opinions i have no idea why you decided that every baby born in the world is automatically endowed with the same views as your leftist group of friends i thought we

of attention but imo the most important achievement of the war against iran was hitting their missile manufacturing storage and launching infrastructure people does not constitute a genocide is an incorrectly correct statements people in srebenica constituted a genocide it s the common rebuttal and it s correct what it doesn t account for is how and why they died which is what actually constitutes genocide not the number the k bosniaks were not civilians killed while fighting an armed force even out of negligence that would be a war crime but not genocide instead they were killed while they were held in custody where they were systematically executed out of combat the was no military advantage to be gained from it the only explanation for why it happened is for the purpose of there existing fewer bosniaks that s what genocide is not the number game cont', 'is your position that israel shouldn t have attacked iran iran literally has a countdown clock in tehran to israel s destruction according to the israelis as if they ever needed a valid casus belli to launch their attacks they believe they own the place and can strike anyone anywhere which will make others wary of their ways and most likely hasten their demise they have been funding terrorist attacks against israel for decades and as if israel never supported any proxy forces anywhere now however they directly attacked a sovereign country by targeting their high officials on their own soil which should amount to a declaration of war which didn t came how do you suggest that israel is doing this because they merely think iran is a threat lol iran is literally the saving grace of israel whose tentacles prop up secterian militias everywhere not just against israel but also other sunni states which might otherwise form a more coherent anti israel coalition israel is literally shooting itself in the foot right now for bibi s amusement they will not emerge unscathed from this but iran is to be less trusted because they are not a democracy and israel is iran is not to be trusted not because they re not a democracy its because they re a secterian shi a state whose agents have been undermining muslim unity in the middle east since the safawid era going even before that as vassals of turkic powers ismaili shi a secterians have been instrumental in weakening muslim power and leaving us open to depredations by crusading forces until of course saladin destroyed their shi a caliphate in egypt israel on the other hand they re outsiders here they are the outpost of a different part of the world that had once toppled a democratic government in iran and replaced it with a puppet shah why should we trust them iran is reaching out to qatar and turkey trying to negotiate an end to the fighting if negotiations reach a conclusion where the mullah regime aligns itself firmly with us and stops abusing the four righteous caliphs and all the sahaba why not we love the ahl al bayt as much as they do the highway out of tehran is jammed with people fleeing thanks israel send more refugees to europe the mossad has infiltrated iran and was able to execute many military leaders and nuclear scientists iran has done none of this you can simply google any of this maybe mossad should have spent more time inflitrating hamas and stop them from launching raids into their territory either they re unable or unwilling whichever it is simply shows to me that israel isn t as invincible as they claim to be you might say hey its the element of surprise i could say the same for this attack i never would have thought that israel would do something so brazenly in violation of international norms but they did like assasins killing their enemies in their sleep in their own homes the consequence of this war will be that for the first time in years iran will no longer be funding and training terror groups to slaughter israeli civilians no it will directly shoot missiles into israeli cities instead and these won t be the cheap ass drainage pipe missiles used by hamas this is exclusively a one way street israel is crushing this terrorist regime as i said israel is merely shooting its own

successfully minimized gazan civilian casualties a law school dean published the below curious to know this sub s opinions any civilian casualty on either side is a regrettable tragedy in its own right but this statistical analysis seems to show that israel has done a good job minimizing civilian casualties compared to other conflicts set aside the unreliability of figures provided by hamas a terrorist organization that falsely accused israel of killing civilians with a rocket that was actually fired by gazan militants even taken at face value it is worth putting hamas figures in context a favorite word of israel s critics it s been reported that of gazans killed have been women and children but according to a un report in a typical war of casualties are civilians israel is actually causing fewer civilian deaths than in the typical conflict notwithstanding the dense urban environment upwards of gazan casualties nearly the total are reported to be children what is not reported is how many of those children are boys and under carrying automatic rifles and thus legitimate enemy combatants plus over gaza s population is under so fewer minors are dying than one would expect if israel were indiscriminately killing civilians what civilians typically do to survive a war is leave in ukraine within a month of russia s invasion nearly of the population had left their homes and had left the country some million people but neighboring arab states have refused to accept palestinian refugees they claim if they do israel might make gazans displacement permanent a curious concern given that israel voluntarily left gaza in and even forcibly evicted jewish residents one would think a theoretical risk of displacement is better than a real risk of dying since gazans can t or won t flee the civilian death toll necessarily climbs and israel not hamas continues to be blamed responses to unprovoked attacks often cause more deaths than the attacks themselves that doesn t make the response illegitimate the attacks killed american civilians in the aghan war that followed between and civilians died the author concludes the hatred of israel is what s disproportionate not israel s response no other nation would respond differently yet no other nation is as hated antisemitism not body count makes the difference edit users have identified legitimate criticisms with point of this line of reasoning criticism point assumes that the of men in gaza are all combatants this is likely not true mitigant point also assumes that of women and children are not combatants unfortunately this is also likely not true betweenwafa idris s action in january and the end of may sixty seven palestinianwomen were counted as planning to carry out suicide attacks mustafa alkhair commander of hamas zeitun battalion revealed how the terror organisation uses their own kids to protect themselves amid the brutal war in gaza this is just sources i found through a quick google search of palestinian women and children combatants couldn t find anything on trans combatants for obvious reasons mitigant hamas itself does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths in its reporting of casualties because it views its entire population as martyrs we are called a nation of martyrs and we are proud to sacrifice many ghazi hamad hamas political bureau mitigant between of hamas s and pij s own rockets land in gaza hamas has fired thousands of rockets meaning a material number of hamas and pij rockets have likely landed on gazan civilians see al ahli hospital so some gazan civilian deaths are likely caused by hamas criticism but according to a un report in a typical war of casualties are civilians the use of this figure is misleading the figure actually says conflict continued to cause widespread civilian death last year notably in densely populated areas where civilians accounted for per cent of the casualties when explosive weapons were used compared to per cent in other areas so this statistic measures what happened in when explosives were used in densely populated areas which is what is happening in israel right now mitigant this statistic measures what happened in when explosives were used in densely populated areas which is what is happening in israel right now so this criticism doesn t appear to be a death knell to the argument but it is important to accurately reflect what the civilian death rate benchmark which is heinously high actually represents edit some posters have asked for the name of the law school dean who posted this his name is martin pritikin', 'notice that this number is the end figure and not the figures in the fog of war which are the numbers that we re seeing currently the point isn t that the numbers we see right now are accurate i pointed out that they aren t and that is to be expected the inconsistency is a product of the difficulty to report accurate information not necessarily that the numbers are faked the past accuracy of reporting lends some credence to the numbers being reported as accurately as currently possible and in good faith this is by no means definitive of course so we can corroborate the reported numbers with other data such as the number of destroyed buildings to get a larger picture another thing that s lacking from this is the crucial difference in who is a militant and who is not something that the numbers of the health ministry don t provide now and something that the estimates that they gave after previous wars were different than the un and israel s estimations as per the un s analysis of the conflict u n researchers start out with figures from the ministry the media and other sources but then cross check them with the help of palestinian israeli and international human rights groups the u n s overall number of killed is slightly higher than that of the gaza health ministry the u n said nearly percent of the total or were civilians defined as those who didn t take part in hostilities and were not members of armed groups source your point is sort of irrelevant when of those killed were determined to be civilians as per the un that being said determining whether someone was or was not a militant is difficult since it requires witness accounts or local community knowledge the current numbers we see indicate significant numbers of child and women casualties which are obviously not militants if we are killing children simply because hamas is using them as human shields i don t understand how that is in any way justifiable it would imply we know children will die before we drop the bomb and we don t care as long as we get a couple militants in the process besides even if it was true in the past it doesn t really answer op s analysis perhaps in this current conflict when the complete destruction of hamas is on the table it acts differently op s analysis is invalid there is no question to answer as another comment pointed out the variance in the numbers is more consistent with the data being batched and reported than being faked op basically just took the numbers at face value in a vacuum and concluded they are fake with no corroborating evidence context as usual is very important i am for the complete destruction of hamas i m not in favor of the complete destruction of gaza which is what is currently happening

about of gaza deaths are women and children tldr summary the un picked some sample to make conclusions when there is a sample from the same source that shows the ratio of casualties that are women and children is i was highly surprised to see the recent spat of articles coming out like this supporting the un s claim that near of the gaza dead are women and children why because they are lying from the article the un s human rights office has condemned the high number of civilians killed in the war in gaza saying its analysis shows close to of verified victims over a six month period were women and children the un agency said it verified the details of people killed in gaza from november to april its analysis found around of verified victims were children and women remember the un uses numbers from the gaza health ministry fta gaza s hamas run health ministry whose figures the un sees as reliable notice they are basing this on counting details of deaths in a period between november and april however we already have many previously published sources even through the un about analysis of a much larger quantity of deaths take this article from may the u n humanitarian agency citing gaza s health ministry says children and women were killed in gaza as of april the u n says gaza s health ministry has been able to fully identify deaths out of more than people the ministry says have been killed in the gaza strip or this article with updated tracking through august the gaza ministry of health moh has released a new detailed list of gazans reportedly killed in the ongoing war since october marking a significant improvement in the accuracy and quality of casualty reporting the report covering deaths between october and august in terms of demographics the new list closely mirrors the april report of the deaths recorded are children under are adults between and and are elderly individuals over in these articles from may and october we can see the of deaths that are women and children is not near perspective i analyzed the moh numbers a month ago and estimated the civilian militant casualty ratio is to if we used the un s false numbers we would end up with a ratio of to those aren t close to each other the latter would be much more indicative of indiscriminate bombing than the former for reference if the number of women children was of the casualties the ratio would be near to which would be in line with most wars that are not even in such a dense urban environment what is the un doing i have no idea did they cherry pick this sample from the that have been accounted for in a way to make the numbers look worse is this an additional people on top of that even in that case the total numbers would only bring the women and children to maybe these are different organizations inside the un if so they have just exposed themselves as being untruthful all numbers come from the gaza ministry of health']"

english speaker so i am using a translator i would appreciate a response in formal english i am not trying to criticize palestine i want to address this from a woman s perspective children are dying yet women continue to give birth are these births truly the result of women s free will how many women would want to keep giving birth while witnessing their children die in a war to what extent are women s rights protected within palestine i am afraid to raise this topic because it might be seen as siding with israel or suggesting that palestine is at fault however i am still curious is giving birth continuously a form of resistance against israel or are women living under pressure to keep having children despite the deaths of children in wartime isn t there any discussion about this add i expressed concern that raising this issue might lead to responses that demonize palestine making it difficult to speak out as expected such reactions have emerged this is hardly surprising please look at how i responded to those comments i absolutely do not agree with such views on the other hand there are also comments here that i find valuable and worth considering it is your choice what to believe add since i don t know how to pin a comment i ll just copy some comments by baker this is a good and fair question and i m assuming good faith despite some pretty strange undertones in the post so i ll do my best and assume it s worth answering with both empathy and facts women giving birth in gaza right now are shaped by overlapping realities of their cultural norms individual choice medical access and the pressures of life under siege some women do see continuing to have children as an act of resilience and continuity but for many it s also about long standing traditions religious beliefs and the fact that when people are really stressed out and having nothing to do they still have sex however i think the actual statistics may surprise you a bit the data i could find from the un on this shows the reality here is far from a story of unlimited choice i ll walk through some of it as it s pretty sobering fewer births unfpa reports that in the first half of there were births in gaza this is fewer than in the same period in with one in three pregnancies now high risk newborns are born fighting if they re born at all roughly of newborns are premature underweight or in need of neonatal intensive care and there s been a more than fold increase in stillbirths compared to three years ago high risk pregnancies have increased unicef estimates that around women in gaza each year have high risk pregnancies and about of births are preterm many of these outcomes are driven by malnutrition untreated medical conditions and the collapse of the health system of hospitals are gone only a handful of maternity hospitals are still functioning and last time i checked i believe who was reporting that more than of hospitals are damaged or destroyed nevermind the limited capacity of what remains marked increase in newborn deaths fuel and supply shortages have led to over newborn deaths simply because incubators or emergency care weren t available so the un agencies have been pretty explicit in the data that women children and newborns are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the conflict both as casualties and through the loss of even the most basic reproductive healthcare so while the reasons for having children are definitely personal and varied the conditions in which those births happen are now deeply constrained and brutal in sum yes tradition survival and resistance i am sure play some limited role but the human cost is staggering and reproductive rights in gaza right now exist in a context where the choice is heavily shaped by

generalizations about the political views of palestinian children which leads me to believe that israel is at the very least trying to rationalize the indifference to their deaths just leave it at israel is doing the best they can but this is urban warfare and hamas uses human shields there is absolutely no reason to talk about the political views of the civilian population unless you want me to believe that israel considers them targets there absolutely has been emphasis on the nature of the brutality of october th in order to justify the mass deaths and destruction there has been quite a bit of emphasis on it with the implication that had it been a normal attack within the bounds of international law israel would just sit back and take it they absolutely wouldn t there would be a retaliation regardless but would they kill as many civilians im led to believe that they are unable to kill fewer civilians the nature of the atrocities committed in october th are simply irrelevant to the scale of the retaliation because the retaliation should be the same either way it s like why don t you do a ceasefire you ve killed a lot of civilians and the answer is hamas committed extreme atrocities and we cant stop now it s a gray area and i understand why it is if you hold the belief that gazans cant be reformed in terms of their hatred then you re in a mentality that is truly not far from the final solution for gaza you understand why i think that right you cant start with the belief that an entire people are beyond reform indifference to their suffering combined with retaliation against militias that live there leads to a sort of passive do i need to say it i cant rule out that a lot of people in gaza just hate israel because israel simply thinks that they should just all drop dead kibbush ha avoda and the jnf wreaked economic pain on the palestinians jews before the second aliyah were part of the culture in palestine jabotnitksy said polite indifference which

hate you my two cents', 'this current conflict began when hamas burned down houses with whole families including children inside them they raped tortured and murdered innocent civilians they specifically targeted civilians and intended and still intend given the fact the are still firing rockets at civilian areas in israel to maximize the amount of innocent causalities israel is targeting military targets and before they do they have given days of advance notice to civilians to get out of the areas the are bombing in order to minimize civilian casualties i would ask first if you see a moral difference between those two approaches the fact they are bombing areas where the know there are likely to still be civilians in spite of their warnings may not be ethical that is certainly an argument you could make and there is some obvious weight to that here s is one important ethical question though hamas has said that they will not stop targeting israeli civilians and killing innocents no matter what happens is israel supposed to continue to allow hamas to hide in gaza and break into israel every few months or so to terrorize civilians included the killing and torture of children like on oct th are they supposed to not protect their children if hamas isn t destroyed they will keep killing people if you value israeli children s lives as much as palestinian children s lives you have to ask the question what will ultimately lead to fewer total deaths of children and suffering of civilians letting hamas exist or eradicating them i m not saying i know the answer but in the real world the answer is not as simple as no children can be allowed to die ever as much as we all might want that there are no solutions in this conflict only trade offs', 'what happened with those aid workers is extremely tragic they were there to help suffering civilians this should not have happened aid workers are supposed to be protected they are supposed to be able to do their jobs undisturbed however we must not forget why things like this are more likely to happen in gaza hamas has a history of dressing as civilians hiding in hospitals pretending to be aid workers they have created a situation where no one can tell anymore who is a civilian and who is a fighter by doing so they are endangering everyone by making them a target israel has no way of knowing which targets are actually civilians and which are just pretending to be israel like every country in the world has to defend itself and its citizens now i am very sure they would prefer a clean fight against hamas fighters with no involvement of any civilians but that s not happening anytime soon hamas does not do clean fights they are cowards they will continue to hide amongst the people they really should be protecting what is israel supposed to do just retreat and accept to never be able to live in peace accept all the bombings from hamas accept their own civilians having to run to bomb shelters all the time give up on freeing the hostages give up on hope to ever just live in peace i ll be honest if it was my country that is threatened and bombed all the time i would be pissed at my government if they wouldn t be doing anything in their power by any means necessary so i can live in peace in the home i built every war is messy this one even more than others i blame hamas they are the one who started something they couldn t finish they are the ones that play stupid games and hide amongst civilians causing all this mess they are the ones who do not care how many people die you can be sure their leaders are celebrating what happened today because of what it does to public opinion they want as many and as tragic deaths as possible israel doesn t the idf is not perfect but if they had the same mindset as hamas there would be no more gaza they have more than enough fire power for that i think i would have stopped supporting israel a while ago if it weren t for hamas threatening to make oct happen again and again if their end goal wasn t to destroy israel and kill all jews if they would just accept that israel exists and will continue to exist if they were actually interested in a

some antisemitism exists within the margins of these protests as it has in almost every broad movement throughout history and i know some protestors especially young ones lean towards edginess and will participate in hate for shock value but equating the entire protest movement to that fringe is like saying the civil rights movement was invalid because some people in the crowd held extreme

egypt was not winning to begin with egypt was not going to conquer israel and didn t think they could their goal was just to push into the sinai but while they pushed through the bar lev line the invasion had been stopped and israeli commanders found an opening in the egyptian front and managed to outflank the egyptians and begin capturing territory on the west side of the suez canal the odds were actually very high that the israelis would encircle the egyptian invasion and wipe it out which is why the egyptians agreed to a ceasefire and why israelis broke it a few times to expand the territory they captured after the war sadat was even more desperate in backroom negotiations offering more concessions to return the sinai to israel eventually he basically gave up the cause of palestinian liberation and leadership in the arab world in order to get the sinai back and get its debt paid off it was a modern arab victory where they didn t get completely humiliated but were still defeated the education system must be really messed up to treat winning an early engagement was winning the war but that s likely to protect the egyptian regime more than anything', 'about i had a lengthy debate about it that spanned multiple days with a guy on this sub to summarize egypt s army concentrations in sinai weren t indicative of a desire for war in june we had a choice the egyptian army concentrations in the sinai approaches did not prove that nasser was really about to attack us we must be honest with ourselves we decided to attack him prime minister menachim bigen in a speech on august the closure of the straits of tiran was a legal move according to the accords egypt had signed at the time it didn t become illegal until egypt signed the agreement during the camp david accords of even if it was illegal according to article of the un charter the parties to any dispute the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security shall first of all seek a solution by negotiation enquiry mediation conciliation arbitration judicial settlement resort to regional agencies or arrangements or other peaceful means of their own choice nasser egypt s president at the time wanted to raise the dispute to the icj israel refused dean rusk secretary of state of the us at the time later stated in his memoir they attacked on a monday knowing that on wednesday the egyptian vice president would arrive in washington to talk about re opening the strait of tiran we might not have succeeded in getting egypt to reopen the strait but it was a real possibility', 'please know the whole story when you make such a message on day in when israel got their independence they were immediately attacked by all their arab neighbors their goal was to annihilate them the arabs in israel also went into battle war against israel so israel needed to bomb and fight back all over the place as a result mainly when israel began to win all the arab citizens ran away which they turned into extensive propaganda all over the world that they were expelled from their homes and are refugees till now instead of getting their message that this is the price you pay for starting a war during all the years until now all the arab countries constantly made statements against israel their days are numbered and we will wipe them later in the late s and s egypt expelled the un force from gaza and sinai and began massing its troops in the sinai israel reiterated declarations that any closure of the suez canal would be considered an act of war or justification for war later jordan and egypt signed a defense pact that they could win against israel the iraqi army began deploying troops and armored units in jordan egypt blocked the suez canal all because they never acknowledge the existence of israel then it exploded when israel launched a surprise air strike bombing most of the egyptian planes you can maybe blame israel for starting the war israel captured the golan heights from syria the west bank east jerusalem from jordan and the gaza strip and the sinai from egypt with all the reality israel thinks that to survive they cannot have a strip less than miles wide meaning without the west bank and the golan which has a lot of mountains is critically important from a military standpoint in israel made a package deal with egypt and offered to give back all of sinai and gaza but egypt refused to take back gaza the peace treaty was just in exchange egypt should recognize the legitimacy of israel back to gaza israel pulled out entirely from gaza in the place was then under palestinian control they got chocolate and a long strip on the beach a year later hamas whose goal is to destroy israel and kill them all came in with a legal election with eu observers on the ground boots the muslim brotherhood originated in egypt in and they had a solid support base in the sinai many were spread to the gaza strip that s why egyp refused to take them back in the s they built some trust until it got to a point where thousands of people came into israel daily for work in the early s propaganda called indifata started people were exploding on buses killing dozens of people it turned out that most terror was caused by people coming in from gaza so israel stopped the permits the results of israel back then and also now their

each bit of bs you wrote here lol but i ll have a crack at it years of rapes bombing kidnapping torture starvation blockades firstly israel hasn t even been a country for this long secondly none of this has been happening for years torture and rape you are implying is a systematic thing which is completely untrue there are very few accounts of this happening ever from the israeli side if when it has happened it is individuals a tiny minuscule proportion of the idf that s not to say it s ok but of course in every country and army you will have one or two people here and there who do terrible things i hope ofc they are brought to justice nonetheless but it s not a systematic thing at all i m confident there were more women raped by hamas on oct than there have been by the idf in the last years you might claim that s incorrect but idc there s so little evidence for any rape cases at all and same goes for torture you re then saying what israel has been doing for years is far worse than oct firstly don t you dare pretend like oct is the only crime ever committed by palestinians they ve had scores of massacres they ve done oct esque things way more times than this was just the worst example furthermore what youre saying is like saying slapping someone once each day for a year is worse than chopping off their finger once oct was by far one of the worst single skirmishes ever as far as i know in global history it was disgusting savage barbaric and shocking how proud the people doing such awful things were people proudly filming them executing civilians defiling corpses raping literally cutting an unborn child out of its mother s womb there aren t words in any language that can describe this that takes so much more inhumanity than even a century of occupation and political oppression you dare claim that the hostages weren t mistreated tell me will you admit you re lying or are you so misled you can believe this garbage they were ffing hostages beaten and bloodied and dragged out of their homes i know some of them have stood and smiled at the exchange and looked good n happy but would you not do exactly what you re told if you knew your captors still held your friends and family knowing if you disobeyed they would kill them do you really think hamas are not evil enough to take hostages and mistreat them we ve all seen the oct footage of all the rape and murder etc not a chance in hell they d treat a single one of the hostages with any amount of human kindness and you have the gall to say hamas fighters would throw themselves in front of israeli fighters to save the lives of the hostages you think for a second this would ever happen you must withdraw all of what you said it s absolute lies and either you know it and you are saying it to dishonestly push your agenda or you are a complete brainless idiot to believe such ridiculousness and you mention candace owens a disgusting antisemite who spreads gross anti jew conspiracy theories online and you are thankful for her you sir madam are an antisemite', 'yet another fake rape claims by palestinians this time it backfired so they admit it was faked as many of you probably know ever since the un started investigating and eventually found clear and credible reports about sexual violence by hamas in october as reported for example by times of israel abc news and even anti israeli orgs like the bbc the pro palestinian side felt the pressure to blame israel of the things they are guilty of as such a fake investigation was started spearheaded by antisemitic actors such as reem asalem and francesca albanese i will not go into detail about that since user did a fantastic job lately at exposing the hilarious hypocrisy lack of any evidence and lies of it all well now as their earlier attempt of a modern day blood libel failed al jazeera tried another go at it using a lying testimony from the current shifa operation which apparently hinged about a fake testimony of a palestinian woman and from there the lie went to al terrorists jazeera from there to social media where many additional fake reports embellished in more stories and details all complete lies but the effect took unprecedented turn instead of just more unjustified hate to israel it also caused palestinians who believed their own people s lies to flee the north and middle of the strip south something very bad for hamas who can t let go of their human shields so suddenly a day later those lies are being retracted this sort of thing has been happening for years now the palestinians make up lies so the world will attack the evil zionists and while it works it also does damage to themselves in plenty of ways well now al jazeera removed all records of the accusation that idf soldiers committed acts of rape here is what former al jazeera managing director wrote on x it was revealed through hamas investigations that the story of the rape of women in was fabricated of course the enemy did not hesitate to commit the crime of genocide the woman who spoke about rape justified her exaggeration and incorrect talk by saying that the goal was to arouse the nation s fervor and brotherhood as if more than thirty thousand martyrs ninety thousand wounded about a million displaced people and comprehensive destruction were not enough from an article from jpost about the whole thing although the qatari mouthpiece has yet to officially refer to the retraction all content related to the allegation has been deleted after more than hours of letting the story run freely qatari mouthpiece al jazeera deleted the page featuring their former story which accused israeli soldiers of allegedly perpetrating rape against women during the idf s latest excursion against hamas and islamic jihad terrorists who barricaded themselves inside the former hospital cum terror headquarters at shifa hospital what is seen here is a classic example of how palestinian propaganda works make up a lie run with it and spread it around the world using billions of antisemites in social media then admit it was a lie quietly and now for the real question will lie number by so called pro

knows the answer', 'do you even read these this is why zionist propaganda is so effective cus people just read titles and dont dig into the actual content let s get right to the nitty gritty what is

conspicuously vague on specifics and it even admits to being based almost entirely on israeli government and military sources the report itself even concedes that the un team was unable to establish the prevalence of sexual violence and concludes that the overall magnitude scope and specific attribution of these violations would require a fully fledged investigation patten even admits in it that israel has consistently refused to cooperate with independent un investigators and probably most importantly patten and her team were unable to locate a single victim and did not speak to any alleged survivors of sexual violence or rape despite making a public appeal for such survivors to come forward and speak confidentially and with assurances of safety and privacy but even regardless of all this patten s report claims that there are reasonable grounds to believe rape took place during the october events and she bases this conclusion on circumstantial information which she claims may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence absolutely and completely vague non information it s all blah blah with zero actual evidence bottom line is there has not been identified any specific victim nor any video or forensic evidence corroborating that rape took place regarding your second source i ask again do you even read these human rights watch was not able to gather verifiable information through interviews with survivors of or witnesses to rape during the assault on october and there is only one public account reportedly from such a survivor human rights watch sent a detailed information request to the israeli government specifically focused on sexual and gender based violence asking to interview individuals employed by the israeli government who might have relevant information and to review relevant documents and images in the possession of the israeli authorities it did not receive a substantive response to this request human rights watch attempted to identify and contact survivors of and witnesses to acts of sexual and gender based violence committed during the october assault researchers were able to make contact with several people who had described their experiences witnessing acts of sexual violence to the media but who did not agree to be interviewed by human rights watch jesus and your rd source is just parroting what your first source reported that s how the zionist propaganda machine works just regurgitate unsubstantiated hearsay from someone with authority with absolutely zero actual evidence to back it up you repeat it

hassan nasrallah knew that israel was attempting to invade anyway so he gave them a free pass to invade or hoped to mire them in a multi front war they couldn t keep going for long enough to win we have to stand with our brothers in palestine ah so you re a muslim lebanese doesn t count you re an occupier and you are currently practicing taqiyya ancient history sure you muslims bring up when it

the islamic dogma a pass whilst claiming that jews adhere to a dogma that jews actually don t have there s nothing in judaism that requires a jewish state to go any further north than it already is but besides that israel is a secular jewish state that does not adhere to any jewish dogma if it did homosexuality would be illegal shabbat would be imposed by law the beit hamikdash would be rebuilt all mosques and churches destroyed etc none of that has happened in israel', 'my friend hezbollah supporters were celebrating in the street after the war was concluded in lebanon because they believed they won the reason they believed they won is because israel did not invade lebanon but israel did not want to invade lebanon you make a fair point but actually it did it wanted to colonize a greater israel and that s why it attacked but it hadn t attacked for years and offered peace to lebanon several times the lebanese flag lit up tel aviv city hall after a port explosion all grandstanding don t you realize how the jews operate ok but hezbollah attacked with rockets israel told it for months to stop without invading and hezbollah refused isn t that provocation that was not israel s fault hassan nasrallah knew that israel was attempting to invade anyway ok but then why is it then when told to leave this alone by every lebanese sect he refused and said that the rockets would not stop unless gaza was left alone we have to stand with our brothers in palestine the same ones that massacred you so often in the s that your parents threw rice at israel when it entered lebanon ancient history ok but if netanyahu unequivocally stated that the objective was only to stop the rockets and hassan nasrallah guaranteed they would never stop no matter what unless gaza was left alone that would imply whoever broke their word lost right whoever was forced to do what they stated they would never do that seems logical well hezbollah stopped firing rockets and nasrallah died but they stopped the israeli advance into lebanon but you just said you really trust the jews very much you really think they didn t want to invade they were just cowardly and didnt want to commit their

just arabs one of the most frustrating issues i see all the time in israeli palestinian discourse is the denying of the palestinian identity and existence yes palestinians are arabs but we aren t only arabs noone is only arab as an identity arab is pretty much too vague to be useful for anything morrocans mauritanians palestinians and saudis are all arab and yet they share practically nothing alike sure they speak arabic but morrocan arabic is mutually unintelligible with many other dialects sure they are all mostly muslim but their are many christians communities who are just as arab their is much much more in common between say british and americans than between all arab communities and ofcourse palestinian as an identity is new but that s obvious arabs in general didn t know borders nevermind borders drawn by western colonialists instead people identified with their region or village or tribe or family yes they were arabs but even back then they wouldn t identify as js arab however when the borders where enforced and suddenly a person of the same tribe or village lived a completely different life to smeone on the other side of the same border a palestinian now has a completely different struggle to a jordanian even if they were literal cousins and so it no longer made sense to identify with you re village tribe etc although village and tribal identity still very much plays a part it made much more sense to identify with you re fellow people who had the same oppressor and so the palestinian identity grew and in the same way every arab identity grew an saudi and a kuwaiti are new identities born out of the fact that their material reality their leaders wealth and everything else is different sure they could be brothers but they now lived in different countries and so identified differently their wasn t a palestinian identity necessarily but their was a wider levantine identity aswell as smaller tribal identities which was cut and joined to make a lebanese identity a jordanian identity a syrian identity etc it s not that palestinians aren t a separate but still included people from the rest of arabs it s js that due to geopolitics and many other factors they ve identified differently and so in modern times the people who lived in modern plstn isrl call themselves palestinian to call them simply arab is not only to tell others what they should identify themselves as but also intentionally ignores the long history of the people who have resided their for centuries palestinians are a distinct people who didn t migrate from arabia tl dr palestinian is a new identity born out of new circumstances sure but it s an identity that exists and its people are distinct and unique and not just arabs', 'i m genuinely trying to understand what you mean when you say you find it offensive to hear that palestinians came from arabia and colonized this land what i said here was a response to the title of this post i m just poking fun at it i don t get offended by it if anything it s quite understandable to think so i m just saying it s false i m jewish around generations rooted in this land my family lived here for centuries side by side with arabs and l ve never denied their presence but the historical record is pretty clear arab presence in this region began with a seventh century conquest the modern palestinian identity as a distinct national group only formed in the twentieth century especially after the s with the creation of the plo and became more politically solidified in the s i think i made it clear in the comment i linked that not all arabs are the same arab is a really broad term sudanese arabs and syrian arabs are not the same yes the arab conquest happened in the th century but there is a difference between arab arabized and semi arabs palestinians are ancestors of the cannites and it s well known and i ve linked proof with my original comment although it s true a good percentage of modern palestinian identity was formed in the s but it s mainly them abandoning their identity for a pan arabist one it s clear that at the beginning that palestinian state hood was only for arab nationalism and it happened across the arab world too when i say arab sudan isn t the first thing that comes to mind yet look at their flag it s literally the pan arabist flag tldr not all arabs are the same palestinians are modern ancestors of the cannites and are thus indeginious so i m just wondering why is it offensive to acknowledge that palestinian identity came through the arabization of this land especially when that s what the history the sourcer and even your own comment suggest i repeat palestinians were arabized but are indeginious yeah i agree with that point the land was arabized and also what exactly do you mean when you say palestinian are you referring to a modern national identity that developed after the s or to anyone who lived here before the state of israel neither i mean modern palestinian peoples even before the arab conquest there were many others and when the romans renamed this land palestina to erase its jewish identity jews didn t start calling themselves palestinians not because they didn t belong here but because the term was created to erase their identity of course they wouldn t adopt a name that was meant to erase them and how is that relevant to palestinian ancestry so when a political movement adopted the name palestine in the twentieth century that doesn t mean it reflects an ancient nation it means it was a modern creation born out of a political moment not historical continuity yeah the land was called cannan at first then israel then palestine imagine modern palestinians wanted to choose a name which one would they choose that doesn t make it illegitimate but it also doesn t make it ancient and if the movement was shaped in part through opposition to israel s existence then isn t that worth examining not to delegitimize it but to understand how identity can sometimes be built in reaction rather than in rooted continuity none of this is meant to deny anyone s lived experience but if we want real understanding we have to be honest about where our identities begin all of them i repeat the last point prior to the land was called by three names israel palestine and cannan which name do you think palestinans would choose', 'the europeans were in what we now know as the us for nearly years they ve shaped and overwhelmingly inhabited the land they are the overwhelming majority of their inhabitants they have deep roots in towns farms culture and land while the actual natives are of the population and even they speak english as a first and often only language and are christians who openly renounce their pagan ancestral faiths their identities religions languages are significantly more extinct than the jews in the pre zionist th century ottoman palestine were that doesn t make the non native americans the indigenous peoples of the us english the indigenous language christianity the indigenous religion that doesn t make any actual native american group into foreigners today and settler colonists if they start peacefully returning to their land no matter how many centuries they were away from them conversely if you decide that the only thing that matters is what happens now you can talk about how the israeli jews have been living in israel for three four generations how they absolutely shaped its land how they form nearly of its population how they don t know any towns farms culture and land beyond the one they live in right now the difference is of course that they don t speak a foreign colonizer language but the last indigenous canaanite language of hebrew they don t identify as any foreign colonizer nation but as the last indigenous canaanite tribe of the jews and to be clear this identity and to some extent the religion is what defines them as jews the israeli jews are a heavily and proudly multi racial group from african black ethiopians to blue eyed ukrainians to the majority of israel which is physically indistinguishable from any arab the arabs are neither currently in israel nor are its historical indigenous inhabitants their traditional ties to the land are the same as any entrenched settler colonial society except they re not even entrenched anymore they identify as arabs they speak arabic they give their children arabic names they worship a foreign arabian religion they politically identify with original arabs from the gulf and act against their supposed canaanite brothers the jews they claim to have a superior right to the land than the jews purely because of the medieval arab muslim imperialist right of conquest the fact their grandparents were a successfully entrenched colonialist class for a long time and their blood not identity language culture or anything else that actually defines an indigenous people they have zero interest in resurrecting any kind of indigenous identity culture or polity but an actual blood and soil claim sometimes expressed in those very terms claims of superior racial purity to the jews claims of more indigenous skin color classic german romantic nationalist claims about how the trees speak arabic and so on and unlike the israelis and even israeli jews palestinians are officially defined in pure genealogical terms as the arab residents of palestine including a tiny handful of largely theoretical palestinian arab jews before the war and their descendants and the political goal of this having millions of people who never set foot in the land of israel immigrate there in order to erase the existing native jewish society and violently replace it with their own a far more classic settler colonialist desire with a far more explicit desire to eliminate the native than even the american colonists let alone what you claim about the zionists and the goal is not to create even the american style settler colonial civic nationalist society with equal rights for the jews that s a lie that some of their supporters in actual settler colonial states came to believe but it s something the palestinians themselves both leadership and people have openly shown no interest in they openly want to resurrect the old colonial apartheid hierarchy that puts the muslim colonialist class on top and the indigenous jews at the bottom or preferrably in classic settler colonialist fashion in the grave there s a reason why unlike mandela s black and white south africans they would never call the israeli jews palestinian jews or themselves israeli jews there s a reason why their first slogans chanted while they massacred their palestinian jewish neighbors in the s was palestine is our land the jews are our dogs why the palestinian constitution and national charter defines the palestinian arabs a population defined in official purely genealogical and ethnic terms as the sole legitimate population of palestine why unlike the israelis who have a thriving non jewish minority who serves in the supreme court parliament and army even the most moderate palestinian leaders insist on a pure arab ethnostate and the ethnic cleansing of all jews who live in palestine why the original arabic version of from the river to the sea doesn t end with palestine being free but it being arab arabiyya just go to the ask project channel where they ask actual palestinians in palestine what they want the one staters openly want the jews gone because it s arab land not jewish land not any form of a rainbow nation if i told you about the various multi cultural and liberal gestures the zionists made from the very beginning from the original herzl book where the protagonist fight for equal rights for arabs to calls to the arabs to join the new state in its declaration of independence to the fact it has a large thriving arab minority you would obviously dismiss it as mere window dressing for settler colonialism but when it comes to the palestinians they re not even providing any of that window dressing they re very open about their eliminationist far more ethnocratic desires but you just choose to not listen and just make up a more convenient ideology and back to the real world i don t get what you re saying in the last paragraph you don t want israel to be erased from the map but the entire framework upon it is built has to be dismantled what does it even mean does it mean being dismantled to the point that canada or the us were decolonized after genociding and culturally genociding the natives allowing the tiny handful of christian english speaking fully pacified and loyal natives to vote get some mineral rights and build casinos making land proclamations where simply acknowledging bragging that they stole the land is considered enough of a penance israel already did more than any english speaking settler colonial state to accommodate its arab minority it actually has arabic as the official minority language that every official government document has to be published in state run arabic language tv channel and schools and state run shari a courts for example but the actual anti zionism what the palestinians want is very much the elimination of israel as a state elimination of the israeli jewish society by expulsion or genocide and replacing it with yet another arab muslim totalitarian conservative ethnostate which will reduce the freedoms and rights of even israel s palestinian arab citizens let alone its jews or women or lgbts or atheists and no i don t see how israelis would accept this with anything short of a nuclear war any more than americans or canadians would and finally as for hatred of jews beyond the general point of how expelling and exterminating seven million jews might be a little anti jewish there s actual empirical data about this anti zionism already became in practice the state ideology of dozens of states across continents cultures and regimes and in every single one of those states with not a single exception it lead to the decimation or complete dissolution of all organized jewish life and most or all the jewish population fleeing even if you want to argue it s not motivated by hatred or motivated by the right kind of hatred it s still the second most dangerous ideology to jews in the modern era after hitlerian racial antisemitism']"

americans and the brits did with the balfour declaration why it s easy access into the middle east and it s easy destabilization of the area for easy oil profits ofcourse getting israel along with the state solution was never enough need the whole pie right i assure you jews would have preferred getting judea and somaria i assure you that no matter how much land was given to the zionists it was never going to be enough and the balfour declaration and the creation of israel was a big mistake all of this was by design to spark a permanent and never ending war between the jews israelis and the arabs edit for some reason i can t reply to you think the balfour declaration was about oil this was years before oil was discovered on the arabian peninsula so nope edit the massive oil deposits that the middle east is known for were discovered by saudi arabia in it was this discovery that transformed the middle east actually it was discovered by americans what a coincidence yes there were some oil deposits in iran that the british had discovered in less than a decade before the balfour declaration but this was a very small proportion of the worlds known oil deposits at the time considering it had only just been discovered in addition there was little to suggest there was more oil in the region and consensus at the time in fact also suggested that there was no oil in the arabian peninsula source the consensus looks like some mighty fine spook work to me there just ain t no conceivable way george bernard reynolds said you know what guys it s pointless so let s just pack up and leave that s coincidence in any case the idea that the balfour declaration could be due to oil is one of the most ahistorical theories i have ever seen you are seemingly basing this on some oil deposits which were almost kilometres away from israel palestine in a country with a completely different ethnic group persians are not arabs iran had actually been on decent terms with israel prior to the revolution and on oil deposits that the british owned anyway so it doesn t really make sense to destabilise the region if that was even happening that ain t the only big steaming pile of shit the brits left behind their other fine works includes the in india pakistan split all kinds of shit shows in africa hong kong and a few well planted spats in asia israel palestine just happens to be their biggest hit and secondly the super convenient shipping routes from israel to the strait of gibraltar is all happenstance right the brits and americans just happened to land on the gold mine of a shipping route what a beautiful ugly coincidence depends whom you ask right ding ding ding we got a coincidence jackpot i mean it all screams like a nice and convenient oil route to me which it is all the big steaming piles of shit actually happen to be important resource extraction locations like ports if this pattern wasn t there then you d be right on my theory being absurd but all of it points towards important ports and important resource locations like it was by design which it is and finally nice job of using block reply so nobody can present any counter arguments now another edit for you need to improve your knowledge of the history here the balfour declaration didn t create israel i mean it s right there the balfour declaration was a public statement issued by the british government in during the first world war announcing its support for the establishment of a national home for the jewish people in palestine then an ottoman region with a small minority jewish population well well well it s basically israel without actually spelling israel that was in at this time there were already tens of thousands of jews living in palestine already hard at work draining swamp creating arable land etc then in the league of nations voted on and passed a resolution to create such a homeland naming the british as administrators of the mandate while the division of land was to be negotiated while the arabs continued to reject any land at all going to the jews the jews continued to build and agree to multiple proposed partitions all sponsored by wealthy groups like rothschild it wasn t all organic and natural at all it was planned executed perfectly for the shipping route from israel to the strait of gibraltar this is the problem with learning history from tiktok and youtube activists they throw out references to things but no one bothers to actually learn about them says the person who gets their history from spook org i mean the pattern is clear as day western interests are to not let anyone have a firm foothold in the middle east and that includes israel the arabs the muslims the russians literally anyone except themselves they want it to be a hot sauce sandbox forever just like asia and europe i mean the way the partitions were handled they were screaming for a civil war until the end of times israelis do have the correct idea of a permanent solution for their stability which is ethnic cleansing yeah i know it s morally crap and i m obviously against this horrible plan as that s the only way they re ever going to stop it and you ll see the west being against it and all the other means which allows israel or anyone else to get a firm handle on the situation it was always about the oil and neo colonialism by design israel s never gonna win and all the rugs will be pulled from under their feet when the signs of them winning are clear', 'yeah cause the region that contained palestine was ruled by the f king ottoman empire for years then the british defeated them in ww in with the help of hussein and his arab revolt against the empire and a jewish spy ring nili the british agreed with him in documented letters in that they would recognize an independent arab state and defer to his territory terms if he staged a revolt his terms clearly laid out that he expected the region of palestine to be made part of that state he is very clear in the letters that he is unwilling to support the british in defeating the ottoman empire side by side unless they could clearly agree to his proposed boundaries meanwhile the british went behind his back and created a secret treaty with france italy and russia at the time before they got got where they partitioned out all that land among themselves sykes picot agreement the british always wanted their own project in the middle east since both france and russia held power in middle eastern regions through the catholic and orthodox churches britain felt left out they cared so very little for the humanitarian reasons for settling jews in palestine they wanted to further british policy it s literally in theodore herzl s diaries the british were also writing to one another heh heh the arabs won t actually build a state they aren t strong enough don t take it serious be vague about the terms while also coming out with balfour declaration saying they would support an establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine lol this was of course after the british failed to resettle jewish people in uganda you wanna know one of the big reasons why the british jumped to give the balfour declaration to rothschild and publicize it i do not think it is possible to exaggerate the international power of the jews british officials wrote to each other they believed that the support of world jewry would be significant to further their aims in the war yep antisemitism and a classic colonial lust for power is what drove the british to offer palestine on a platter and trust hussein reached out to the british like yo wtf is this i thought we agreed that that region was for the arab state and they fucking lied and told him that clearly the ottoman empire made up the declaration to turn him against them they assured him that the turks were messing with him and they wouldn t even think of doing such a thing so he helped them defeat the ottoman empire and when they continued to seize and occupy land after arabs knew something was up and hussein knew that they intended to violate their agreement they did and this dude refused to sign any treaties after that versailles sevres etc even when the british offered him for his signature and for him to recognize the balfour declaration ya know the one they told him wasn t real he stood his ground and said no that he would not as a leader consent to the handing over of palestine that he never agreed to so what did the british do the withdrew their support of him and funded his rival saud and told him reaaal sorry youre getting attacked man why don t you recognize the declaration and we can help you out he said no saud armed by the british went on to conquer hussein s kingdom and exiled him effectively getting him outta the way the imperial powers stole the land from the people who lived there and handed it out promised it to a nation of people with no regard for the consent of the governed clearly this is the craziest cliff notes but yeah', 'that being said i find a lot of you comments misleading and inaccurate ok and here s your first assertion after this they actually did try numerous times that was the entire reason there was a british mandate for palestine this is misleading as the discussion is about the creation of an arab state side by side with the jewish state at the dissolution of mandatory palestine on may you re implying that jews blocked the creation of an arab state alongside theirs which is incorrect arguably to this day they kinda did though previous the the balfour declaration there were the mcmahon hussein correspondence these were correspondence in in which britain stated they would recognize arab independence if they helped them the arabs helped the british maps were draw as to what land would be allowed for arab independence the british accepted the boundaries which included palestine first mcmahon actually added conditional language to his commitment to hussein that specifically acknowledged the sizable non arab population in the region the districts of mersina and alexandretta and portions of syria lying to the west of the districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo cannot be said to be purely arab and must on that account be excepted from the proposed limits and boundaries furthermore and ironically palestine appears to only have been specifically and directly referenced in documented british promises to the jews balfour declaration and the league of nations mandate for palestine itself regardless on may both britain and the un abandoned the jews and never enforced their promises jews had to declare their own independence and defend their own brand new state from the day one invasion of arab countries you re not incorrect that the jewish state did not inherently involve the theft of arab lands but that s not how the arab s took it land that the british had promised to them was now being given to another group of the land was offered to of the population they saw this as a theft especially when they only owned less than of land the justification was to make room for holocaust survivors the arab league did not believe they should have to sacrifice land for something which they were not involved in they believed jews should be given refuge in countries that were fighting against the nazis beyond this there were also issues with the jewish state having control of the vital water supplies and land on a majority of citrus farms and all of the most fertile lands any qualms arabs may have had with the deal should ve been negotiated via diplomacy if they wanted to negotiate borders the way to do that was at a deal table and not on the battlefield maybe it was hubris that they outnumbered the jews maybe it was the commitment of several arab nations to come in and destroy israel before it got off the ground deciding to fight instead of talk opened up the arabs to lots of unfortunate consequences just to add a bit of context the overall arab league consisting of egypt jordan syria lebanon iraq saudi arabia and yemen rejected it there was a lot of inter conflict in the group each monarch or leader had their own political agenda for example egypt wanted palestine to not be an independent state but to become a part of egypt unknown to the arab league jordan was working with the jewish agency to come to a counter agreement given the involvement of all of these surrounding arab nations was this truly about the establishment of an independent palestinian state for a distinct group or was this about preventing a jewish state so all of the land could be absorbed into these states after all from to both gaza and the west bank were under egyptian and jordanian control respectively yet arabs continued to try to destroy israel and never made any serious attempt at the creation of an independent palestine it s very disingenuous to categorize this as a self inflicted wound primary because this wasn t the palestinians war it was the arab league very few were involved what happened to the palestinians was a direct result of the actions of the arab league which they were not a part of furthermore israel s refusal to allow the palestinians to return to their homes after they fled because they did not want to be involved is incredibly important israel instead gave the homes to jews of destroyed them this is on israel this sounds a lot like was committed by hamas gazans are innocent of gazans weren t even alive to vote for hamas can you please provide compelling evidence that demonstrates that palestinian arabs were not on board with the arab league s invasion it s completely unrealistic to expect israel to unconditionally allow the return of arabs after a war that threatened its very existence']"

good faith discussion from the un article defines the crime of apartheid which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern africa you stopped mid sentence either you did not understand the text or you chose to cut the clause that decides the issue that is not honest argument here is the line you clipped with the part you left out in bold for the purpose of the present convention the term the crime of apartheid which shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination as practised in southern africa shall apply to the following inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them that is the test a regime of domination the intent to keep it in place and the listed inhuman acts not annexation not citizenship conduct two items from article ii are directly on point and you left them out ii c exclusion from political social economic and cultural life including denial of the right to a nationality and the right to freedom of movement and residence ii d measures that divide the population into separate reserves and ghettos and expropriation of landed property south africa implemented policies against the south african people not an extraterritorial area if israel were to annex the west bank that would fit the un definition no annexation and citizenship do not appear in article ii international law attaches to effective control south africa already tried the move you are leaning on it carved out the bantustans stripped national citizenship and claimed the system was outside its responsibility the world rejected that legal fiction and the convention is written to pierce it if there is an institutionalized regime of domination an intent to maintain it and the listed acts the crime is made out whether the map lines were redrawn or not if you want the parallel criminal law definition the rome statute states it plainly an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other committed with the intention of maintaining that regime no annexation caveat there either and under icerd article racial includes national or ethnic origin the citizenship wordplay does not change the analysis a quick legal point occupation law and the apartheid crime are different bodies of law one regulates the conduct of an occupier the other punishes a domination regime they can apply at the same time control without incorporation does not insulate a system that meets the elements of article ii the jim crow laws in america are most analogous jim crow is a history lesson not the standard the standard is elements do you have an institutionalized regime systematic domination and an intent to preserve it plus acts like political exclusion restrictions on movement and residence segregation into separate areas and expropriation of land if yes it fits that is what the text says when you quote all of it not just the half that helps you', 'that s a great question apartheid in it s original meaning explicitly referred to the legal racial segregation in south africa from to a system of discrimination and exploitation that unfairly penalized south africans on account of race it is similar to jim crow in that both refer to specific periods of legal racial discrimination within a single country nowadays people typically use the word to refer to the general practice of legal discrimination against a subset of people as you quoted perhaps those people don t need even to be citizens as you say but there does need to be a legal means by which the discrimination takes place occupation is a very different practice though there are a few similarities that stand out occupation refers to the military intervention a country exerts into a foreign territory not within its borders the actual length of time can very wildly from days to decades but a military occupation is always intended to be impermanent people living under a military occupation are still subject to the laws of their own territories the west bank has a palestinian authority that governs it s people they are not subject to the laws of the occupying power because they are not citizens the occupying power may exert influence over their lives and will likely treat them very differently than their own citizens but that is to be expected that treatment might resemble apartheid because it is discriminatory but it is extremely different at its core the difference ultimately comes down to israel s goals and strategy broadly speaking israel s justification for the extended military occupation is security given the history of conflict in the region it is an understandable stance if you believe that israel started every war it has ever been in maybe you would disagree but then we would have to back up and to agree on basic facts since the goal of the occupation is security israel maintains a military presence as long as there is credible chance of a threat occuring the implication is that israel would not need to continue the occupation if there was no genuine expectations of a security risk as it stands today that seems unlikely but israel doesn t want to be expending it s resources on military occupation it does so out of necessity for the protection of it s citizens for the system to be apartheid we are missing one crucial factor annexation if israel annexed the entire west bank and gaza and then continued to treat the palestinians living there as second class citizens they would do so through legal means codified discriminatory laws policies and practices and we could rightfully call them apartheid israel is in fact a state where laws exist and generally govern behavior the people living in israel are subject to these laws people living under israeli military occupation are not subject to israeli laws because they are not living in israel every country has the responsibility to protect it s citizens countries that fail to do so usually don t end up sticking around for a tiny country like israel it is especially vital that it figures out how to protect it s citizens effectively and sometimes that means taking drastic measures look at where israel is look at its history and try to approach it scientifically and with curiosity most of the surrounding and nearby countries do not want israel to exist as they have shown many times and with many wars israel has actively worked for decades to find peaceful solutions with its neighbors it has won land in defensive military operations and then given that land back as an attempt towards peace this is one of the reasons why egypt and israel have good relations now it has come to the table for peace talks negotiations many times and with sincere efforts only to be pushed back into a defensive position by wars and intifadas i don t know you and i won t assume your beliefs but if you believe this tiny country is truly as evil as people say why has it been so successful how has it

not to harm needlessly but from israel s perspective it is doing what it must do to keep it s citizens safe have you seen how vitriolic just the people on reddit can be regarding israel these are people that believe wholeheartedly that the country has no right to exist that it should be disbanded somehow and who cares what happens to its citizens imagine how much more hatred fuels the extremist ideologies that lead people to strap bombs to their chests and blow up civilian bus stations imagine how much extremism and hatred has to exist for that behavior to be not only normalized but glorified and financially incentivized if we want to solve problems in the real world we need to look at reality israel does exist and doesn t plan on going anywhere if you want it to not exist you will have to destroy it it has the right to protect itself but even if you don t think it has that right it will defend itself regardless the only real question that remains is when will the palestinian leadership accept this fact and come to terms with a peaceful solution']"

whatever what is being advocated for is in the other post and even in your comment is the latter ethnic cleansing specifically targets people because of their ethnicity or religion whereas enforcement actions target individuals based on legal status not identity completely false that sort of standard would allow any state to ethnically cleanse they just create a law which an entire population violates i want to clear x territory from group y i say make it illegal to live within miles of z river and enforce the law the key distinction is intent where the state acts against a legal violation not a group s inherent characteristics and the intent of the un is to maintain the racial purity of palestine large number of un members view jews as a racial pollution and thus believe palestine is legitimate in rejecting jewish emmigration no one objected to many instances of immigration that are similar for example russians in eastern europe certainly not decades later and applying to descendants the norm is precisely the opposite of what s going on with israel the deportation of illegal immigrants is generally not considered ethnic cleansing they are when they are done in mass and the communities they live in are destroyed upholding international law is crucial because it restores justice and establishes precedents that prevent future violations really gaza hamas are blatent

prevent future violations i m not ignoring it i think the removals have discriminatory intent and the whole settlement argument is a cover i also don t think non discriminatory intent grants one

international law and do not support the killing or genocide of such people expulsion is killing you bomb rape burn down homes murder until they leave that s how it is done and before you go to the

absurd one no matter how common it is on the internet ironically israel is the only country in the region that did not systematically expel ethnic and religious minorities from its territory whether during war or in peacetime just in the levant in the th century alone the jews were originally ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in both gaza and hebron in almost years before israel declared independence and almost years before the first settlement in the wb not to mention the ethnic cleaning of virtually all jews from syria lebanon and the kingdom of jordan in the middle of the th century according to red cross and unrwa records over jews were ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in the wb including east jerusalem in when the arab legion invaded and jordan illegally occupied the territory for almost years even the jewish quarter of the old city of jerusalem was cleared of all jews and demolished in when it was captured by the arab legion and renamed arab east jerusalem that divided jerusalem until jordan forfeited its west bank in after losing another gratuitous war of conquest against israel on the other hand israel did not systematically expel arabs from its territory in fact the israeli declaration of independence specifically invites arabs within its sovereign borders to remain as israeli citizens and help to build the new country together many arabs did which is why over of israeli citizens are non jewish arabs with equal citizenship rights there were plenty of members of many arab ethnic groups and minority religions like the druze and beduins who fought alongside israel against the invading arab legion in and were proud to do so compare the multiculturalism and secularism of israel with the territories under the control of hamas and the pa that remain completely judenrein since at least it s quite a contrast the fact is that despite being the jewish state israel is the only secular country in the region where religious and ethnic minorities have equal citizenship rights and freedoms and where women and gays also have equal rights you will never see a gay pride parade in either gaza or ramallah for example almost of israeli citizens are muslim arabs and even more are christians druze beduins zoroastrians and bah s religions and ethnicities that face discrimination and oppression in the surrounding ethno centric arab and islamic countries but have found refuge in israel the bah faith s international headquarters for example known as the bah world centre is located in the northern city of haifa in israel unlike the situation in the territories under palestinian rule all israeli citizens both men and women have equal rights and freedoms regardless of religion ethnicity sexual orientation or national origin a situation not found in any of the other countries in the region arab muslims serve in the israeli parliament for example muslims serve as commanders in the idf there is even an arab muslim justice on israel s supreme court and he s not the first religious and ethnic minorities just do not have the same rights and freedoms in any of the other countries in the region like they have in israel the irony is that jews do not serve in the palestinian government or in the governments of any of the other countries of the muslim world precisely because they were gratuitously and systematically ethnically cleansed from their ancient communities in those countries in the middle of the last century almost a million jews were gratuitously expelled from their ancient communities in all the countries of the muslim world from morocco east through egypt and yemen north through syria and lebanon all the way through iraq and iran a century ago for example the population of baghdad was a third jewish they were jews living in their own ancient communities in iraq that predated the invention of islam and the arrival of the arabs by a thousand years ironically most israeli jews today are not ashkenazi jews from europe as many people on the internet seem to believe but are in fact the descendants of those refugees expelled from the arab and muslim world they re sephardic and mizrahi jews and babylonian jews expelled from iraq and persian jews from iran', 'on the topic of gradual genocide gaza s population has only gone up over the last years this fact alone challenges the idea that they have been experiencing a genocide over this timeframe to call this a genocide would go against the definition itself and would open the doors to the loss of meaning of the word genocide itself which would make future designation of the term in other conflicts more difficult this would have negative consequences on the implementation of international law and would reduce the validity of the term itself with regards to ethnic cleansing i can see that this is something the far right israeli government is pushing for however ethnic cleansing is not genocide i am absolutely against ethnic cleansing of course and i oppose this policy completely what muddies the water on this topic though is the definition of ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic racial or religious groups from a given area with the intent of making the society ethnically homogeneous unlike the definition of genocide the term ethnic cleansing does not include national groups the palestinian identity at its core is a national identity not ethnic consider the fact that ethnically palestinians are the same as jordanians and israeli arabs after all they were part of the same country prior to i e the british mandate of palestine it is only in recent years that they have been considered a distinct group based on a shared nationalist cause please note that i am not trying to justify the removal of palestinians from gaza here i am only trying to use accurate terms which is what the whole aim of my post is in essence i would not say that genocide needs a new name but in this case i think the usage of the term ethnic cleansing needs a new name instead i am saying this from a scholarly perspective and i am not trying to make a moral or political commentary on the situation in gaza but rather i am calling into question the very language we use to accurately describe what is going on morally my stance on the situation in gaza is that people who want to leave should be able to and those who wish to stay should also be able to israel should not force either outcome on people in gaza and the gazan s should have the agency to decide on their fate israel should introduce more provisions to prevent forced expulsion such as resuming the flow of aid and the pursuit of a political resolution to the conflict such as the implementation of a new governing

the oppression of jews as dhimmi until there were definitely times being an oppressed second class citizen in muslim countries was significantly preferable to being a dead body in christian countries and in the year history of active oppression there probably were periods where it wasn t too horrible just as no reasonable person today would claim anti black racism is gone from the us because we had a black president no reasonable reading of history can ignore the systemic injustice against jews from islam just because some jews had some level of status at times muslim anti semitic xenophobia

first zionist congress at the absolute very least in the early s germany and amin al husayni had a very popular and influential arabic radio station dedicated to spreading antisemitism and anti zionism it would never have been successful had antisemitism been purely some foreign thing i m sure there were some arabic countries less dominated by islam and better at coexistence by the th century but from my understanding that was definitely the exception not the rule', 'the anti semite has chosen hate because hate is a faith at the outset he has chosen to devaluate words and reasons how entirely at ease he feels as a result how futile and frivolous discussions about the rights of the jew appear to him he has placed himself on other ground from the beginning if out of courtesy he consents for a moment to defend his point of view he lends himself but does not give himself he tries simply to project his intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse i mentioned awhile back some remarks by anti semites all of them absurd i hate jews because they make servants insubordinate because a jewish furrier robbed me etc never believe that anti semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies they know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge but they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words the anti semites have the right to play they even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors they delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert if you press them too closely they will abruptly fall silent loftily indicating by some phrase

se antisemitism works differently from other kinds of racial hatred and is not straightforward i find sartre s anti semite and jew to be a very insightful essay into the matter he writes that the antisemite attributes all or part of his own misfortunes and those of his country to the presence of jewish elements in the community and proposes to remedy this by depriving jews of certain rights by expelling them or exterminating them sartre also finds that the antisemite is a prime example of a person who has entered into bad faith to avoid responsibility antisemitism is a way of feeling good proud even rather than guilty at the abandonment of responsibility antisemitism is a construct of a mutually exclusive concepts and jews are simultaneously semites non whites to the antisemite of the right and white to the one on the left communists to the right and capitalists to the left effeminate and weak to the neo nazi and strong ultra aggressive to the tankie etc whatever discontent one has with their society it is eventually found to have been caused by the jews jews brought the black plague jews caused the economic downfall of the weimar republic jews caused the bolshevik revolution jews oppressed the proletariat and threatened socialism etc this is a thousand year old tradition that has not disappeared every social crisis inevitably results in discovery of jewish culpability when american policemen shoot unarmed black men we discover the jews are truly culpable contrary to all evidence some activist says israel trained american police to use choking techniques therefore it must be true israel killed george floyd israel made american police use stop and frisk techniques too israel is culpable for american police brutality and jews who have never been seen as white by those for whom being white is a virtue are now seen as hyper white by those for whom whiteness is an unmitigated problem most antisemites don t realise they are antisemites and would swear on their lives they don t hate jews they are simply outraged at a social injustice that is inflicted by the jews when sending jews to the gas chambers germans sincerely believed they were serving social justice for the societal and economic downfall the jews inflicted on them these sentiments are now shifted to the jewish state the primary obstacle to world peace is israel the left has a very serious problem with antisemitism that stems from the influence of soviet political thought and propaganda and to be clear soviet antisemitism was influenced by nazi ideology which was influenced by the protocols making the far left and right the two sides of the same coin the modern far left would never admit how strongly influenced it is by the fsu but it will scream anti zionist slogans invented by kichko the fsu s ideological goebbels and later ivanov when accused of antisemitism the soviets replied zionist lies antisemitism is antithetical to socialism this is why the modern woke left will never scrutinise its fundamental concepts for antisemitism to do so is to destroy their whole worldview this is also why they are hyperaware of all kinds of structural oppression racism ableism sexism heteronormativity islamophobia etc but antisemitism is conspicuously absent from the discourse they want to believe a year old systemic problem disappeared in and could only be the fault of the far right critical race theory itself has an ideological jewish problem but to admit it is to destroy the worldview tldr anti semitism is an unsolvable problem sorry for the long post i am too verbose

show this since the start of the war i ve seen plenty of people advocate for an end to the blockade whether it be online in speeches or the couple of protests that i ve been to if you re asking about specifically advocating for egypt to end it why would we do that we can just advocate for ending the entire blockade when israel is primarily responsible for the blockade or when we can advocate for ending the genocide or for countries to stop sending israel weapons additionally since you seem to think that people who are pro palestine are disingenuous in our care there are plenty of fundraisers for raising money to help individual gazans get out or for raising money for relief additionally i ll note that about gazans have already left via egypt', 'frankly i do not want to get engage in

among children doubled in one year due to the blockade clinics run by middle east council of churches also reported treating increasing numbers of underweight and malnourished children the blockade in

the us were alleged to have supported fatah against hamas and supplied weapons and information in a bid to overthrow hamas basically a military coup which the us has a long tradition of doing the us trained fatah soldiers in anti terror attacks and lifting supplies and weapons to the presidential guard of palestine who were filled with loyal fatah soldiers and sent cia aid to mohammad dahlan the main fatah opponent against hamas from hamas perspective they launched a pre emptive strike something israel has also used to justify a lot of their actions against fatah to stop the coup from even materializing in the first place thus the rest of their military actions from their viewpoint like rocket attacks and wars against israel is a deterrent action against another possible israeli and us coup and as payback for what the us and israel tried to do in certainly any other country in the world if they found out their neighbor next door tried and failed to militarily overthrow them in a coup and supported their enemies would expect payback and revenge which the us has done numerous times by sanctioning invading and overthrowing their enemies for a hostile action that threatened their sovereignty i ll post some links and sources below from wiki again on this the pro fatah view is that it was a plain military coup by hamas the pro hamas view is that the us drew up a plan to arm fatah cadres with the aim of forcefully removing hamas from power in gaza according to the pro hamas view fatah fighters led by commander mohammed dahlan with logistical support from the us central

government despite being opposed to israel and having full civil rights and being a population majority that has always been allowed into their homes that s just me playing around with what you said so far the reality is that israel expelled muslims from their home when they settled in because muslim arabs were definitely the population majority now they have the full civil rights on paper but as proven by the current events those are just to save face israel can say they have full civil rights but also say that they have to evict from their homes at some point in time and the muslim arabs can t do anything about it i don t even know why you re talking to me the full picture is obvious from how israel tear gasses full rights civilians in the aqsa mosque and arrests their children regularly

ben gurion in no descendent of palestinians whether israeli or not has the right to claim property they fled from in that the israeli government seized and redistributed this does not apply to jewish israelis who have used the law to resettle east jerusalem by kicking palestinians who had moved in using pre property deeds this is why thousands of arab israelis march to the site of their former villages every year as a protest against this discriminatory policy the right to family and spouse immigration arab israelis whose extended families are often split between several different countries as well as gaza and the west bank do not have the right to apply for a pathway to citizenship not even a greencard or visa for their relatives with a small exception from when the knesset was not able to renew this policy israeli palestinians who married non israeli palestinians also could not get citizenship or even identity cards for their spouses jewish israelis however do have full rights to family and spouse naturalization and immigration the right to trial under israeli law arab israelis as outlined by a recent vox video can be sent to military and not civil court for crimes of a political nature where the guaranteed rights of an israeli citizen no longer apply to them while these crimes can include violence it can also include things like social media posts this never applies to jewish israelis even when facing trial for settler violence or hate crimes some of these rights are denied in order to control any threats to the jewish majority demographics of israel this is why the current vision of zionism where an unchallengeable jewish majority is necessary depends upon the repression of certain arab israeli rights but that was not the case of the visions of hertzl

israelis the israeli declaration of independence of israel says there should be complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants regardless of religion race or sex it also supports freedom of religion conscience language education and culture while on paper equal a number of official sources acknowledge that arab citizens of israel are unequal to jewish israelis in many aspects of life the arab citizens of israel live in a reality in which they experience discrimination as arabs their inequality has been documented in a large amount of crible surveys and studies and have been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions we know sadly the jewish majority s awareness of this discrimination and inequality is quite low nonetheless it plays an important role of arab citizens this discrimination is widely accepted both by jews and arabs alike the u s state department country reports on human rights practices which one would assume to be pro israel notes that israeli arab advocacy organizations have challenged the government s policy of demolishing illegal buildings in the arab sector and claimed that the government was more restrictive in issuing building permits in arab communities than in jewish communities thereby not accommodating natural growth in june the supreme court ruled that omitting arab towns from specific government social and economic plans is discriminatory this judgment builds on previous assessments of disadvantages suffered by arab israelis israeli arab organizations have challenged as discriminatory the master plan for the northern areas of israel which listed as priority goals increasing the galilee s jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of arab towns israeli arabs were not required to perform mandatory military service and in practice only a small percentage of israeli arabs served in the military those who did not serve in the army had less access than other citizens to social and economic benefits for which military service was a prerequisite or an advantage such as housing new household subsidies and employment especially government or security related industrial employment the ivri committee on national service has issued official recommendations to the government that israel arabs not be compelled to perform national or civic service but be afforded an opportunity to perform such service according to a university of haifa study a tendency existed to impose heavier prison terms to arab citizens than to jewish citizens human rights advocates claimed that arab citizens were more likely to be convicted of murder and to have been denied bail the orr commission of inquiry s report stated that the government handling of the arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory that the government did not show sufficient sensitivity to the needs of the arab population and did not take enough action to allocate state resources in an equal manner as a result serious distress prevailed in the arab sector in various areas evidence of distress included poverty unemployment a shortage of land serious problems in the education system and substantially defective infrastructure the u s state department country reports on human rights practices notes that according to a study at hebrew university three times more money was invested in education of jewish children as in arab children according human rights watch says cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents military service discriminate against arab children the cuts will also affect the children of jewish ultra orthodox parents who do not serve in the military but they are eligible for extra subsidies including educational supplements not available to palestinian arab children in just of civil servants were arabs even though arab israelis are of the population the bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in israel and one of the highest in the developed world and that s no accident the budget of israel s health ministry allocated arab communities less than of its budget for healthcare facility development in march several israeli civil rights groups stated in a report that the current knesset was the most racist in israeli history with bills proposed in and that would discriminate against the country s arab minority a preliminary report commissioned by israel s courts administration and the israel bar association found in which is very credible found out that arab israelis are more likely than israeli jews to be convicted of crimes after being charged israeli law also discriminates between jewish and arab residents of jerusalem regarding rights to recover property owned before the madness in the arab israeli war the absentees property law said that any property within the land that israel conquered which was owned by an arab who had left the country between november and may or by a palestinian who had merely been abroad or in area of palestine held by hostile forces up to september lost all rights to that property which is shut ridiculous palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by jewish or israeli forces before and during the arab israeli war but remained within the borders of what would become israel aka internally displaced arab israelis are deemed present absentees by the legislation which the phrase present absente i et self sound like an oxymoron present absentees are regarded as absent by the israeli government because they left their homes even if they did not mean to leave them for more than a few days and even if they did so against their will following the six day war in which israel occupied the west bank from where it annexed east jerusalem israel then passed in the law and administration arrangements law allowing for jews who had lost property in east jerusalem and the west bank during the war to reclaim it palestinian residents of jerusalem absentees in the same positions and arab israelis present absentees who owned property in west jerusalem or other areas within the state of israel and lost it as a result of the war could not and still can not recover their properties israeli legislation thus allows jews to recover their land but not arabs i once saw a post that said sex was the only hope to solve the conflict well you are about to be disappointed in the case of mixed arab jewish marriages it s quite controversial more than half of israeli jews believed intermarriage was equivalent to national treason according to a opinion survey a group of jewish men in the jerusalem neighborhood of pisgat ze ev started patrolling the neighborhood to stop jewish women from dating arab men the municipality of petah tikva has also announced it would provide a telephone hotline for friends and family to report jewish girls who date arab men as well as psychologists to provide counseling the city of kiryat gat launched a campaign in its schools to warn jewish girls to not date the local bedouin men sentiments work both ways a survey found that of israeli muslims and of israeli christians would be uncomfortable with a child of theirs marrying a jew of israeli jews would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a muslim and would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a christian the mossawa center an advocacy organization for arabs israelis blames the knesset of discrimination against them they cited a increase in discriminatory and racist bills submitted to the knesset in the year according to the report bills deemed by the center to be discriminatory and racist were placed on the legislation table in such bills were initiated in in bills deemed discriminatory by the mossawa center were discussed in the knesset the reports calls out racist proposals such as a bill to revoke government funding from organizations acting against the principles of the state the coalition against racism and the mossawa center said that the proposed legislation seeks to de legitimize israel s arab citizens by decreasing their civil rights inequality in the allocation of public funding for jewish and arab needs happens regularly there is massive employment discrimination as well in february the new york times reported that percent of the impoverished families in israel were arabs in human rights watch described government run arab schools as a world apart from government run jewish schools the report found major differences in basically every aspect of the education system in the follow up committee for arab education said that the israeli government spent an average of a year on arab students compared to for jewish students the drop out rate for arabs was twice as high as for jews versus there was a classroom shortage in the arab sector according to the u s state department country reports on human rights practices for israel and the occupied territories israeli arabs were underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most universities and in higher professional and business ranks well educated arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education according to sikkuy arab citizens held approximately to of the country s university faculty positions arab educators have long voiced concerns over institutionalized budgetary discrimination an august study published by the hebrew university s school of education claimed that israel s education ministry discriminated against arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the average per student allocation at arab junior high schools was one fifth the average at jewish ones this was due to the allocation method funds were first divided between arab and jewish school systems according to the number of students in each and then allocated to needy students however due to the large proportion of such students in the arab sector they receive less funds per student than jewish students the ministry of education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index ministry data on the percentage of high school students who passed their matriculation exams showed that arab towns were ranked lowest except for fureidis which had the third highest pass rate in israel racist polls a poll by the arab advocacy group the center against racism showed negative attitudes towards arabs the poll found that of jews believe arabs are a security threat would refuse to live in the same building as an arab believe that arab culture is inferior to israeli culture support for segregation between jewish and arab citizens was higher among jews of middle eastern origin mizrahis another poll by sammy smooha found that of jewish israelis avoided entering arab towns and cities feared the possibility of widespread civil unrest among arab israelis a poll by the center against racism found that of israeli jews would not live in a building with arabs over would not invite arabs to their homes believed that arabs should be stripped of the right to vote over agreed that the state should encourage emigration of arab citizens to other countries considered arab culture primitive asked what do you feel when you hear people speaking arabic said hate and said fear only reported positive or neutral feelings a poll of israeli high school students found that did not think arab israelis were entitled to the same rights as jews in israel and thought arabs should not be elected to the knesset surprisingly for me these figures rose among religious students a pew research poll released in march showed that close to half of all israeli jews are in favor of transferring or expelling arab israelis of israeli jews strongly agree or agree with the idea and strongly disagree or disagree the in person polling was conducted in a relatively calm period from late through early calm in this conflict s standards arab polls in a patriotism survey of arab israelis were not proud of their citizenship and were not ready to fight to defend the state another poll by sammy smooha found that of arab israelis justified hezbollah s capture of idf reservists ehud goldwasser and eldad regev in a cross border raid thought israel was justified in going to war following the kidnapping justified hezbollah rocket attacks on northern israel during the lebanon war of israeli arabs saw the idf bombing of lebanon as a war crime while of israeli arabs viewed hezbollah s bombing of israel as a war crime and said they were concerned about a possible mass expulsion of israeli arabs described zionism as racist and personally most disappointing for me of israeli arab citizens denied the holocaust ever happened surveys in found a radicalization in the positions of arab israelis towards the state of israel with of israeli arabs recognizing israel s right to exist as a jewish and democratic state down from in and believing israel has a right to exist as an independent country down from in polls also showed that of arab citizens engaged in holocaust denial a arab jewish relations survey compiled by prof sami smoocha in collaboration with the jewish arab center at the university of haifa shows that arab israelis said they blamed jews for the hardships suffered by palestinians during and after the nakba in denied the holocaust the percentage supporting the use of violence to advance arab causes climbed from in to in say they reject israel as a jewish and zionist state while opposed its existence under any terms saw the jews as foreign settlers who do not fit into the region and will eventually leave when the land will return to the palestinians a survey by mada al carmel the arab center for applied social research asked the arab students what obstacles they felt they faced in getting into university said the psychometric exam was the primary obstacle while cited jewish racism of those surveyed felt no pride in israeli achievements in whatever field and reporting negative feelings about them why i made this post there has often been a bit of an illusion of citizenship that many hold the illusion that arab israelis are equal to jewish israelis of course this is an illusion not held that arab israelis don t have and now thanks to the madness recently this illusion has broken for the world and is breaking for many israelis and that s one good thing that came out of the violence many israeli jews are now aware of how their fellow citizens actually feel it looks as is if the arab population is being used as a fig leaf by the israeli government to give off a look we ain t racist look of course if you ask an arab israeli it is no question that the government is racist and they are not equal that being said thanks to a decent economic situation and liberal rules in israel not including the west bank and gaza they are still better off than any other arabs in the levant sadly the same can t be said about those in the occupied territories i think the recent madness will make israeli jews more sceptical or hatful of the arab israelis rather than sympathetic and arab israelis will just get more anti israel especially in the age of social media in conclusion arab israelis are not equal to jewish israelis because they are given a lesser education lesser infrastructure and funding are discriminated against both systematically and by the public as they are a minority and the polls back this up lastly i called them arab israelis even though this is a bit of an outdated term just cuz saying anything else would have been longer']"

dozens of times that modern day jewish groups and palestinians share a genetic connection it is a known fact that they came from the same gene pool this in itself dismantles your claim that all palestinians were converts to christianity or islam since non jewish groups who were genetically identical to jews also inhabited judea such as the idumeans the philistines greeks who assimilated and mixed with the canaanites amorites moabites etc these palestinians could easily have been descended from any of these minorities and never have had a jewish ancestor especially since empires like the romans expelled jews several times from judea your argument is trash because it blatantly claims that palestinians are converts but you falsely claim that jews are converts at the same time if both groups or converts what is your point your implication is that jews are less jewish if they converted but palestinians are more jewish since you believe they converted to other religions it s an entirely ridiculous premise and it can t be considered to hold any validity when such a wildly delusional method is used you are engaging in racial science which is not the defining feature of any identity known to man except those assigned by racists judaism isn t a blood quantum and neither is palestinian identity for example the hundreds of thousands of palestinian turks the gazans whose dna is majority egyptian if gazans who are egyptian are still palestinians why are jews who are canaanite not jews being palestinian isn t really defined by anything other than nationality you have conceived this unfair standard of blood mixing and identity none of it matters since identity is based upon how you identify palestinians by their nationality and jews by their ethnic culture which is recognized as a religion furthermore jesus was born in bethlehem well there are two bethlehems bethlehem of judea west bank and bethlehem of galilee some have found evidence that jesus would have been born in bethlehem of galilee considering its proximity to nazareth where he grew up it s well recorded in the christian bible that jesus had a galilean accent galilee has always had a continuous jewish presence today galilee is part of israel i guess by your delusional standards the geography of where he was born would make jesus an israeli jesus was not a palestinian arab muslim he was a jewish israelite there s no possible way to claim him for a culture and identity that has no connection to him besides ancient race science it s like saying julius caesar was italian american or saladin was arab he was kurdish just doesn t really make any sense if jesus was palestinian it was the palestinians who killed him and the christians would have been massacring palestinians and making them wear yellow stars for hundreds of years but instead history remembers that christians did this to jews it s well documented that the catholic church has blamed the jews for the death of jesus for centuries the catholic church is of course a roman authority it is obvious who the romans thought the jews are', 'that makes no sense ok maybe a little bit both arabs and jews possess canaanite dna but we know from history that the jewish kingdoms replaced the canaanites in the region the canaanite dna persisted simply because the canaanites predated the jews in the area were not eradicated and their dna persisted but no one disputes that the jewish kingdom replaced the ancient canaanite civilization palestinians also have arab dna from the arabian peninsula when the arabs came they mingled with a population that already had canaanite dna hence the dna persisted until the s the palestinians saw themselves as arabs in coalition with the other arabs in the region they never saw themselves as descendants of the canaanites the arabs in palestine saw themselves as part of a larger arab state it was never even meant to be an independent palestinian state they had names such as south syria proposed jordan proposed to absorb the whole thing all that dna and ancient history is important but impossible to unravel in you had two groups of people living in the land who saw themselves as indigenous both had peoples in the land for centuries who never left despite changing colonial powers both imported people in the s i don t see how any of this leads to jews having less of a right to palestine the two parties were constantly fighting with the minority jews seeing times as many casualties per capita as the arabs a partition plan was made the arabs got of the british mandate when you count in jordan they got of the levant which includes parts of egypt and other surrounding arab countries for some reason jewish self determination in a tiny part of that land was something they could not countenance and decided to go to war', 'palestinian people are literally canaanites lol indigenous to palestine their dna is literally predominantly levantine with not much penisular arab ancestry palestinians test closest to the canaanite skeletons from megiddo ashkelon sidon and south palestine seems like you haven t done your homework also many palestinian christians converted to islam and many many samaritans converted to islam too this is well documented and easy to fact check palestinians are descendants of canaanites and natufians canaanites have been living on that land for almost years natufians are the first civilisation of that soil dating back years multiple genetic research studies on excavated canaanite skeletons and dna comparisons with modern populations have found that palestinians derive around of their dna from levantine canaanites rest is admixture with peninsular arabs mesopotamians africans and europeans google the below terms and see for yourself palestinians bronze age levantines where did the palestinian dna come from palestinian dna bronze age levantines palestinian genetics palestinian dna where does the palestinian dna come from palestinians canaanites furthermore greeks referred to palestine as palestine before the time of jesus so way before romans the name was then officially changed to palestine just over years ago first recorded name of that land was canaan years ago present day palestine was split into phoenicia philistia judea galilee edom and arubu tribes lived in the far south in the negov most of these groups were never jewish area of today s palestine was around jewish years ago rest were polytheistic canaanites throughout the land and arubu tribes in the south syrian golan that is also being occupied by zionists was also never jewish around of isr el are ashtenazi jews ashtenazi dna is european caucus and turkic and only around or less is middle eastern there have been jewish communities in egypt syria and greece before the time of jesus people willingly converted and moved who is to say they aren t converts from there also many romans converted to judaism before this was outlawed central and south italians have around levantine dna due to various historical events dating years ago who is to say ashtenaxis aren t european converts in large numbers their culture is european they are european yemeni jews are genetically purely peninsular arab they are the same as muslim yemeni there was even a jewish kingdom in yemen hundreds of years ago ruled by a convert to judaism they are converts so are ethiopian jews and indian jews etc only jewish groups that actually have a genome similar to palestinians lebanese druze jordanians and samaritans are iraqi kurdish syrian and egyptian jews this still gives them exactly rights to any land anywhere loool it s a bizarre concept many groups have moved or were exiled through history doesn t give them any rights to lands their distant distant ancestors might have lived in a study by the new york genome center found that the predominant component of the dna of modern palestinians matches that of bronze age canaanites who lived in palestine and levant around bce years before today palestinians among other levantine groups were found to derive of their ancestry from bronze age levantines relating to canaanites impact from before bce years before present historical records and later genetic studies indicate that the palestinian people descend mostly from from ancient levantines extending back to bronze age inhabitants of levant a study by ver nica fernandes and others concluded that palestinians have a primarily indigenous origin a study haber almarri et al found that palestinians cluster close and are similar to lebanese druze jordanians and syrians a study looking at the whole genomes of world populations found that the palestinian samples clustered in the middle eastern genomic group which included samples such as samaritan bedouin jordanian and lebanese are indigenous people of that soil this study is great too study by haber almarri xue et al from and see who the actual native people of levant are

bigger now than at that s primarily because the us has not yet admitted what the enemy is that it is fighting muslims have known for years westerners are a little slower on the uptake', 'everybody keeps telling us gazans mostly don t like hamas here are some relevant stats a majority of say it supports the holding of presidential and legislative elections in the palestinian territories in the

mohammad shtayyeh and haniyyeh participation rate would decrease to and from among those the former receives and the latter in an open ended question where no names were provided to respondents we asked the public to select a successor to president abbas the largest percentage selected marwan barghouti went to haniyyeh followed by shtayyeh and mohammad dahlan each khalid mishal and yahya al sinwar each hussein al shaykh and selected mustafa barghouti a total of said they do not know or do not support anyone when the same question was asked in a close ended format with names provided the public expressed preference to marwan barghouti to succeed abbas by followed by ismail haniyyeh khalid mish al mohammad dahlan and mohammad shtayyeh and yahya al sinwar each and hussein al sheikh said they do not know or have not decided between the somewhat varied opinions and the fact that most gazans as in residents of the gaza strip are children i think gazans are mostly indifferent not knowledgeable enough immature in regards to hamas and politics but they still do enjoy a fair amount of support although that might have changed as a result of this war ok you say doing so in gaza is dangerous yes but it still happened like in august of this year', 'we recognise that gaza has not held an election in atleast years so since when hamas was elected into power after which they stopped all elections its logical to say that you cant say they represent all palestinians because palestinians have been deprived of the chance to decide on who should represent them for years many in gaza today would likely not even want hamas in power and likely if given the chance without fear of retaliation would vote against hamas if anouther election were held today when hamas s term ended and they did not hold elections that was the time for gazans to rise up and overthrow hamas and hold new elections there are two responses to this the gazan people didn t care that hamas stayed in power and or preferred that hamas stay in power in this scenario even tho there weren t elections the gazan people tacitly gave their approval of the hamas government if true then it seems the gazan people are somewhat to blame according to what you stated about israel or the gazan people did care that hamas stayed in power and didn t want it however they were not strong enough or organized enough to overthrow hamas if true then the gazans are victims of hamas as much as israelis are no matter which one you pick the result is the same hamas has to be destroyed politically and militarily in gaza it s just a matter of methods and implementation that you disagree with']"

pushing towards escalation and any specific escalation can be justified by its preceding event i am a therapist who has dedicated his career to working with trauma and i have seen these cycles of escalations writ small but still devastating in the lives of many individuals and families people who are hurt people who hurt others because they are hurting people who hurt others because they are afraid of being hurt themselves i hear the echos of pain and hurt throughout generations like ghosts that feed off of pain to grow stronger the first thing you learn in doing trauma work is that separating out victims and perpetrators is often a messy proposition and one that shifts depending on what time or what relationship you are focusing on in any given session people are often both sometimes even simultaneously if you go into trauma work looking to find heroes and villains you will find more than you ever thought possible and none at all the second thing you learn is that you cannot wait for the pain to lessen before the healing can begin the pain lessens because the healing begins the third thing you learn is that healing is not a passive experience it is often a courageous and defiant act against what the body and mind has learned is fundamentally necessary to keep themselves safe trauma tells truths about the dangers of the world but lies about the roads that travel from and through them it divides people relationships and experiences into rigid binaries of strength and weakness safety and vulnerability winners and losers fighters and victims trauma tells you that the only way to make it through the fire is to run faster fight harder and smash obstacles or set controlled burns ahead of you so the fire is always in your sight and never coming up from behind to heal means forgoing all that not listening to that damaged part of your psyche no matter how convinced it is that the fire is going to engulf you the moment you deviate from what it knows is the only way to keep you safe and fourth and perhaps most challenging at least for me lesson learned in trauma work is that true justice can be a lighthouse to steer one s ship but it isn t a destination many will ever reach that apology you hoped for may never be coming or may never fill the hole you hoped it would seeing your perpetrator suffer rarely makes your suffering feel any lighter hollywood endings are make believe but grace and forgiveness are real and accessible and their power towards healing often takes people by surprise so i will not answer your question as a diplomat or politician but i am not someone who hasn t sat at a table and helped negotiate functional treaties with trauma before it can be done in this case it would mean israel taking the bold and courageous step of choosing diplomacy and restraint over brute military force not because brute military force could not be justified but because it will ultimately further the cycle of trauma and escalation that is in no one s interest including israel s own israel could have seized the moment of initial international sympathy and shock to draw in closer to its western allies and the strained but with some recent progress towards normalizing relationships with the arab world itself and amplify international condemnation of hamas and unite pressure on and isolation of hamas amongst those who otherwise might have been less willing or engaged israel could have strengthened its relationship with fatah plo in the west bank through restarting meaningful negotiations there in return for real security guarantees and thereby showed the benefits of the alternative to the approach hamas took in gaza and israel could have negotiated prisoner exchanges for the hostages while also giving a clear deadline for further steps including militarily if the negotiations did not progress the negotiations would need time and undoubtedly gruelling patience and involvement from arab partners if they were to be fruitful but there may have been space for them to be successful under the right circumstances particularly if israel was able to use its restraint and its reopening of negotiations with fatah to build on its progress with normalizing its relationships in the arab world is this fair is this justice those are the wrong questions sadly if you are truly committed to healing and breaking free of the cycle of mutual destruction that is driving israelis and palestinians into the blood saturated ground a ground that doesn t care at all about fairness or justice as it swallows up

means the number ranges between to arabs there are two main phases of the israeli war of independence or as the palestinians refer to it as the nakba phase one november through to mid may of the decision to partition the land to an arab and jewish state is adopted by the un in november of accepted by the jews and rejected by the arabs in this phase the british mandate is still in effect there is no israeli army formally there is the paramilitary organization of hagana which at the time is mostly focused on defending jewish towns and neighborhoods from arab attacks during this time at least to arabs leave and they do so on their own accord the reasons for their leaving range from not wanting to be part of the new jewish state if they stay according the un partition map and some out of fear from the impending full scale war that neighboring arab states were threatening if the jewish state were to be created these people were not expelled by israel in any shape or form the second phase from mid may through to the armistice signed in in this phase some arabs were expelled by israel some escaped because of the fear of war and some were advised to leave by arab countries and return with the victorious arab armies so during this period another to exit it is virtually impossible to tell what percent of these people left solely because they were expelled by the israeli army all evidence is that there was no formal policy of expulsion so even if were expelled by israel that would mean to people the claim one can make is that after the war ended they were not allowed back in but in all fairness their condition to coming back was the dismantling for the jewish state and also the jews that were expelled from arab countries were not let back in either the arab exodus began voluntarily as early as december when established arab families in haifa and jaffa realized that according to the un partition plan the cities they lived in were slated to fall under jewish control similarly wealthy arab residents from the western neighborhoods of jerusalem began to leave in historian benny morris s words the arab flight became a sort of contagious disease spreading from house to house neighbor to neighbor street to street neighborhood to neighborhood and later from village to village the upper and educated classes feared being killed or wounded and feared the anarchy that accompanied the gradual withdrawal of the british civil and military administration most of the high class families who left haifa jerusalem jaffa acre and tiberias believed their exile would be temporary this phenomenon was described in the contemporary palestinian press as follows the first group of the fifth column traitors are those abandoning their homes and businesses and going to live elsewhere many of them lived in great comfort and luxury as soon as the first sign of trouble appeared they took off to avoid bearing the burden of the struggle directly or indirectly the neighboring countries did us a great disservice by accepting these who fled the battlefield they are the worst type of our fifth column traitors and deserve the harshest punishment from the palestinian newspaper al sha ab june according to morris following their departure the peasants and urban poor were also forced to leave having witnessed the mass flight of the wealthy which led to the closure of businesses schools law offices clinics and public services adding to this was the withdrawal of the british the departing people left due to fear of being left to face the zionist enemy alone despite the poverty and difficulty associated with leaving morris describes the first months of for the arabs of palestine as follows feelings of general collapse and disintegration in many places a small spark was enough to make the residents pack up and flee residents of arab cities fled and in doing so dragged along with them the rural population of the surrounding areas the causes for the departure of roughly a quarter million arabs in the first half of were largely internal arab causes lack of leadership economic hardship breakdown of law and order the voluntary departure in the early months of the war due to the absence of leadership and collapse of order can be seen in this report from a palestinian newspaper the residents of the large village of sheikh munis and many other arab villages in the tel aviv area have disgraced us all by abandoning their villages with their belongings and their children one cannot avoid comparing this shameful flight with the steadfast stance of the haganah in settlements located in arab regions but what use are comparisons for we all know that the haganah rushes into battle with courage while we flee from war from the palestinian newspaper al siraj march the voluntary departure in spring due to calls from arab leaders and institutions is reflected in this report from the economist correspondent in palestine in the days that followed the israeli authorities who now had full control of haifa called upon all arabs to remain and assured them that no harm would come to them to the best of my knowledge all british residents who were asked by their arab friends advised them to stay various factors influenced their decision to flee there is little doubt that the strongest factor was the broadcasts from the arab higher committee which called on all arabs to leave haifa it was made clear to them that once british forces completed their evacuation the armies of all the arab states would invade palestine and drive the jews into the sea it was also implied that any arabs who remained in haifa and accepted jewish protection would be considered traitors at that time the arabs of palestine still had some trust in the arab league s ability to deliver on its promises from the economist london october about two years later the editor of the lebanese newspaper al huda habib issa summarized the matter in hindsight in an editorial immediately after the british publicly announced their departure from the mandate in palestine the arab league began convening meetings and conferences its secretary general abdul rahman azzam pasha issued many declarations promising the arab nations that conquering palestine and tel aviv effectively the jewish capital would be as simple as a military parade azzam s statements noted that the armies were already at the borders and that the millions of pounds spent by the jews on land acquisition and economic development would surely fall into arab hands since it would be a simple matter to throw the jews into the mediterranean the arabs of palestine had no choice but to listen to the advice of the league and believe what azzam pasha and others told them that leaving their lands was only temporary and would end within days with the successful completion of the arab campaign of punishment against israel from the daily lebanese newspaper al huda june expulsion orders formal organized expulsion orders were issued to palestinian arabs during the war on two main occasions during the implementation of plan dalet when the haganah shifted from defense to offense and expelled arabs from key transport routes and border areas after the conquest of ramla and lydda there is no dispute that some of the refugees were expelled but the actual number is likely less than of those who actually left the new historians with the opening of israeli and british archives years after the war a new wave of research emerged led by the so called new historians these scholars argued that everything previously published about the war was largely zionist propaganda by official historians however even they had to acknowledge many arabs left without being expelled their criticism of israel was that israeli policy was to prevent their return even when they wanted to return their return was banned villages destroyed fields ruined or handed over to jewish settlements etc both the british national

misappropriated by hamas leaders iran funded the weapons and training of soldiers in the tunnels yet israel gradually opened the borders with gaza by october work permits had been issued to gazans to come to israel work and commute back to gaza bring much needed money directly to gazans for the first time in the long term pacification after hamas is destroyed can work the narrative that each death in gaza is a martyr that creates more terrorists isn t provable even if it may or may not have occurred in afghanistan or iraq the annihilation of isis is a better example where this didn t occur the german prime minister recently visited israel and reminded the world that after ww when germany was totally destroyed the german people blamed hitler and the nazis not the allies there is some evidence that this is happening in gaza we will see once hamas is gone a peaceful political movement can form if not gaza will remain a refugee camp for decades', 'two things first americans vastly overestimate how much taxpayer money goes toward aiding our allies foreign aid all of it not just israel s share accounts for of the u s federal spending budget in the government gave billion to

second if we have any concern whatsoever about the spread of islamic extremism and the threat it poses to women children lgbt folks free speech and moderate former and non muslims everywhere including in palestinian territories defending israel is key while hamas presents itself as a palestinian movement whose goal is to eliminate israel and establish an independent palestinian state stretching from the river to the sea this movement is also part of the global muslim brotherhood mb whose ultimate goal and vision is the establishment of a worldwide islamic caliphate hamas leaders and spokesmen repeatedly express that their movement will not liberate only palestine but aims to bring all the islamic countries and eventually the entire world under islamic rule the liberation of palestine they stress is just a prelude to the establishment of a worldwide caliphate rome will be conquered by islam as constantinople was once conquered and then the rest of the world will be overtaken as well including america and eastern europe arab writers have in fact slammed hamas for this aspect of its ideology and rhetoric in a recent article published in the wake of hamas october massacre in southern israel egyptian author dr mouna al hilmi wrote that hamas purports to be fighting for the liberation of palestine but its ultimate goal like that of the mb is the restoration of the caliphate yemeni journalist hani salem mashour made similar remarks in a recent article in the emirati daily al arab hamas political bureau member and former minister of the interior fathi hammad declared on a december show on al aqsa tv hamas gaza that the palestinians are preparing to establish an islamic caliphate with jerusalem as its capital he said the palestinian people have been soldiers throughout history they are now preparing to liberate jerusalem and the al aqsa mosque and i am saying this loud and clear the palestinian people are preparing to establish the caliphate with jerusalem as its capital city inshallah jerusalem will not only be the capital city of palestine as an independent state it will be the capital city of the islamic caliphate hamas leaders our goal is establishment of global islamic caliphate not just liberation of palestine the middle east media research institute december palestinians special dispatch no', 'yes because we should believe everything israel says because israel are already so kind and peaceful to those on the west bank who do not have hamas right it s easier for us to just think hamas bad and israel good but it just isn t the reality i read the israeli newspaper haaretz and i found an article commenting on his speech as i wasn t aware of it before found some interesting points made by the author we dismantled the military bases in gaza but not in the west bank just as israel believes it is entitled to bomb in response to a shelling so does hamas see itself as entitled and even obligated to respond to the harm caused by israel to the west bank s palestinians and what will happen if they lay down their weapons the pretense that hamas is an equal military opponent to israel serves its political purposes and image but it does not free palestine in contrast it helps israeli propaganda the palestinians are not israel s neighbors they are the indigenous people who emerged lived in and developed the land long before zionist immigration leaving aside the historical circumstances that led to its founding israel was established at their expense through the expulsion of over half of them and the creation of a political system that from the beginning intended to exclude them almost million palestinians live under the year old israeli military and shin bet rule whether directly like in annexed east jerusalem and area c hybrid direct and indirect such as in the palestinian authority enclaves or effectively as in the gaza strip the government of israel determines nearly every significant parameter of their lives it controls the borders it controls the water resources and land that it appropriates according to its own desires the freedom of movement and thus the economy too family and social connections all this while the palestinians are deprived of any civil rights and are barred from participating in the process of electing the government that determines their lives two states for two peoples parroting the hollow slogan is the required lip service in international forums but we can t accuse lapid and his advisers of providing this service here the blame lies with european and arab nations which have enabled israel for the last years to carve up the territory designated for a palestinian state and turn it into small disjointed enclaves surrounded by constantly expanding settlement blocs like his predecessors when lapid blathers about the two state solution he really means the seven state solution greater israel and the six or maybe even more palestinian bantustans as i say it s difficult to look at things objectively and it s easier just to ask why hamas didn t just take the deal it s not that simple even this article will have some bias but they are israeli authors and i think their cynicism is justified more than others']"

fund palestinian charities as well so there s a conflict of interest in the local reporting as well as academic aid org law org news coverage of the region with these conflicts there s no reason for academics aid law orgs regional news etc not ignore unrwa s transgressions another corrupting factor is that unrwa has a vast amount of staff compared to other united nations refugee charters i forget the exact numbers now but i believe it makes up most of the united nations employment base as the palestinian population continues to explode so does the number of unrwa staff grow and therefore the size of the un s budget itself so an unresolved growing palestinian problem directly feeds the un s growth so unrwa employees executives more or less run the un now as the elephant in the organization

cover for palestinian terrorists including smuggling arms in un ambulances and hosting meetings of tanzim in un buildings on august the idf accused hamas of stealing three ambulances that had just been transferred through israel to the unrwa the unrwa spokesman denied the claim a week later hamas confirmed it confiscated the ambulances due to bureaucratic reasons a unrwa spokesman also confirmed this but soon retracted this admission and denied the incident even publicizing a photo it claimed was of one its officials with the ambulances during the israel hamas war one of the

borders in its partition plan because of the fact that of palestinians would fall under the jewish portion of partition while of jewish people in the region would have been in the palestinian portion of partition i see no world in which that is an equitable division of the land look at the insane map they drew to accomplish this kind of outcome you will never convince me that this was done in good faith it is gerrymandering at its finest do you really think those are borders that will foster long term peace edit even the negev is strategically important it narrows the path to a tiny choke point by which egypt can supply material aid to the west bank without violating jewish sovereignty all the coastal regions that would allow for goods to flow to the west bank would also fall under these circumstances i m not calling for the destruction of anything i m calling the partition plan inherently biased against palestinians for the benefit of the proposed jewish state i think this is a fundamental flaw in arguments that jewish leadership accepted the plan but palestinian leadership refused it so they are entirely to blame for present circumstances the outcomes of partition were drastically different between the two parties this isn t casting blame on the jewish community for accepting partition i would absolutely take the deal in their position i m saying the un s offer was inequitable on a practical level and an apples to apples comparison of the decision to accept partion is not valid i kind of repeated myself there but i think this is a truly important part of the history and current events of the region that is glossed over', 'the partition s fairness as towards percentage of land to preface this my question isn t a gotcha but rather an attempt to actually understand a position because i see this come up again and again i often see pro palestinian voices argue that the un partition plan was unfair because the proposed state of israel was allocated about of the land while the proposed state of palestine was allocated that while israel was to be jewish arab and bedouin it was an injustice to give israel more land than the majority arab state of palestine but when you look at the details most of the extra land given to israel was the negev desert which in was almost entirely arid and non arable from what i ve read according to un analyses from the time only around ish of cultivable land was in the jewish portion while the arab state would have controlled over of the arable farmland put another way the jewish state got more square mileage but much of it was desert the arab state got less land overall but most of the fertile farmland that raises my question why is the vs talking point repeated so often while the far more important issue of arable vs non arable land is left out also i m really not looking for a discussion on whether the partition should have happened what atrocities from either side lead up to it what happened after the partition failed also yes jews owned about of the arable land arabs owned and the rest was state land i get that but i really hope that if personal ownership comes up it is in the context of the question at hand and not a tangent not that it isn t interesting but that i m hoping that this post can keep the scope of the discussion narrowed to this point', 'im sorry for your loss in all the discussions i have had about this you are literally the second person that has said so i truly do appreciate it the united nations partition plan for palestine was always unfair arabs outnumbered the jews yet they always got the smallest of lands so why accept it that s why i mentioned the peel commission in arabs favor jews accepted arabs rejected and initiated an anti jewish riot the british then made the woodhead commission making three maps progressively chipping off the potential future jewish state until by it was just down to chaim weizmann said we would be fools not to accept even if the jewish state were the size of a tablecloth jews accepted arabs rejected frustrated the british gave up and passed the problem to the un for the un plan numerically you are correct to in the jews favor but lets look at what the entailed all of the highlands meaning all of the arable farmland except half of the jezrael valley the more fertile half stayed in the arab portion all of the potable water including the aquifers that fed into the jewish portion except the kineret all of the jewish holy sites except for safed and tiberias the jewish portion was what was offered in map of the woodhead commission plus an empty portion of negev the populated part was given to the arab portion israel had always the intention to colonize the other territory if not then why are there illegal settlments in the west bank they shouldn t be there they are being used as a cynical political weapon by a criminal likud government whose leader will more than likely be voted out and jailed in besides the gaza disengagement proved how temporary they can be settlements fully evacuated and demolished and jews moved out of gaza back into israel hopefully as a part of a more concrete peace plan the majority if not all will be done away with as well they should start with kfar tapuach a disgusting cesspit of fascist kahanists israel is not willing to compromise as we speak its still bombing palestinians and arresting palestinians in the west bank all the groups from the al aqsa martyrs brigade to izz ad din al qassam brigades abu ali moustaffa brigades omar al qassem forces lions den etc all have as a part of their ideology the yearning for shahada it very conveniently gives them the impetus to put headquarters arms and materiel even attack staging areas in schools hospitals and mosques and they make damn sure that they remain active for them its a win win either they get to kill jews or palestinians die and it makes the jews look bad some have gotten to the point of thinking no matter what happens we will be hated people are going to die anyway in this exchange better it be them than us it is a nasty place to be and nobody wins in that place dont chose to be blind to genocide just because its not happening to your people no words have meanings the palestinian population has increased times since that is not genocide after the shoah the jewish population to this day still has not returned to the level it was at in people are dying innocent people scores of them and it is a shame that must never be forgotten but no genocide of a people comes with a population growth there were violences from both sides since the british mandate but that doesnt mean all jews or all palestinians are bad agreed wholeheartedly a very good palestinian friend of mine a university professor told me words that still stay with me we are destined to be together whatever that means in life and peace or in pain and death we will be together and sont quote religious

responsibility for plus he was a direct politcal ally of adolf hitler and personally recruited divisions of muslims to fight for the waffen ss what most people don t know was that he was also in

terrorism both directly and indirectly which included airline hijackings and the black september murders of israelis at the munich olympics the world was unaware of arafat s arrival at united nations headquarters on november until he addressed the general assembly he walked into the lobby armed he was asked to leave the gun at the entrance in his speech he said he held an olive branch in one hand

just who is actually at fault is a little murky only occupation in history where the land s previous occupiers the jordanians willingly turned down the land when offered so what what has this got to do with palestinian aspiration for statehood only occupation in history where the occupied sat down and agreed to it agreed to it the oslo accords were meant to transfer the west bank to the pa in five years they didn t agree to permanent israeli control also i don t remember much agreeing going on when israel occupied the land in only occupation in history that could end tomorrow if the

through the current israeli blockade now assuming those two very impossible objectives could be cleared it took the idf years to build the iron dome do you think the idf wouldn t bomb the shit out of a missile launching device before completion given that long amount of time to act also important to note the iron dome isn t designed to defend against sophisticated ballistic missiles isreali aircraft launch at palestinian apartment complexes its primary use is against mortars and simple rockets the iron dome would defend against nothing if palestine had one', 'the overwhelming majority of hamas missiles are metal and propellant and little else they can inflict damage if they hit someone almost directly but more often than not will cause a small hole in the sidewalk or punch a hole in a tiled roof some apparently use a fertiliser based head that can ignite rather than explode on impact but most do not you can rest assured that if they did have explosive capacity the damage in israel would be considerably worse israelis insist that the reason why there are so few israeli casualties is because of iron dome iron dome s makers claim a success rate of although historically it has been far lower than that and the data for success rates come from the idf s press department in it was reported that iron dome had intercepted out of rockets that is a success rate of note in the past missile defense experts have expressed massive scepticism about iron s dome s effectiveness and crucially nobody else is rushing out to buy it notably no purchases from gulf states concerned about iran india about kashmir azerbaijan ukraine etc israel claims hamas has fired missiles in this latest outbreak at an success rate for iron dome we would expect to see some considerable damage missile damage sites at a success rate you would expect to see landing sites you won t see anything like this in the israeli press pictures of hamas rocket strikes are rarer than hen s teeth ostensibly israel censors pictures of hamas rocket damage because it does not want to reveal landing locations the reality is there isn t much to show there will be no major rebuilding of anything in israel even if the idf s own press release data effectiveness of iron dome were actually true which it almost certainly is not hamas missiles do the same job that israel s non lethal roof knockers do even allowing for the fact they have no guidance system and some will land in fields the sea etc israel s press censor blacks out mentions of landing sites almost completely israel knows that it is crucial to keep the framing that a hamas missile is what people expect a modern projectile with high explosives detonated on impact capable of taking down a building the other day in typical bothsideism the bbc showed a multistory building in gaza reduced to rubble before adding that in israel hamas rockets were causing damage showing a flooded israeli apartment and a scene of a road accident in tel aviv where a man had died because of something to do with rockets other examples of people hamas missiles have killed include an old lady injured running for a bomb shelter i do not want to trivialise hamas missiles but they are so qualitatively different from the popular view of missile that their description is deliberately misleading it is central to israel s framing to focus on the missile counts and implictly treat its rockets tonne high explosive modern ordinance as equivalent to hamas rockets crude homemade affairs that cause disquiet in israel but cause little damage the propaganda dutifully repeated ad infinitum is that all missiles matter and the only difference between what the israel does and what hamas does is success in other words israeli propaganda basically tells israelis that if it weren t for iron dome bomb shelters etc that the horrific pictures they see of whole gazan families buried under rubble would be their fate from hamas missiles this is patently bullshit israeli sniper rounds are also missiles and do far more damage than hamas missiles apparently they don t count even though israel routinely fires into gaza and maimed more than palestinians in one year alone where hamas does have more success is the use of mortars which it uses more sparingly and mostly against military targets near gaza these are routinely referred to by the media as rockets but they aren t iron dome is ineffective against mortars mortars only work at short ish range but do contain explosives and are deadly when they hit a target', 'why tollerate rocket attacks because iron dome when arguements how israel should more proportionally react to gazan s attacks the arguement kept being made that israel should just accept the rocket attacks because it has iron dome and gazan does not i ve also read that israel should shut iron dome down for the fight to be fair i think it s pretty self explanatory why this reasoning is bullshit but i will do so anyway because people seriously appear to believe it a israel has the iron dome because it uses its aid to invest in self defense gaza does not have iron dome because it doesn t invest in self defense only in weapons and terror tunnels b iron dome only has a success rate which amounted to peope killed and people injured in may alone c operating iron dome is not exactely cheap israel is dedicating a significant amount of its budget to it which they could better spend elsewhere but can t d iron dome doesn t protect from psychological damage of kids in southern israel have ptsd depression and miscarriages are also high e a war is not a sport where every time needs to be subjected to the same rules every country is entitled to using the advantages it has this is especially true for a victim like israel that is only defending itself edit f iron dome also only intercepts rockets that would hit civilian targets rockets that would only hit non residential areas are allowed to land and cause damages damags that israel then has to repair x b so why do people claim israel is not the victim just because it has iron dome how do they seriously expect israel to shut it down to make the squabble fair']"

land they lived on the un partition plan was rejected because it was a colonial project that awarded of the land to a minority group that owned less than of it they didn t want it all they justifiably refused to have their country dismembered and given away by foreign powers framing their resistance as xenophobia is dishonest but today israelis are strong and any actions taken against the palestinian arabs is bullying bullying did you actually read the post you re replying to he s describing his comrades openly espousing nazi like ideology calling for holocaust to all arabs and he s witnessing his country commit what he rightly calls a genocide to describe that as bullying is a grotesque minimization of reality it s a pathetic attempt to make systematic slaughter sound like a minor scuffle why don t you work to improve things by joining a zionist pro palestinian organization this might be the most absurd part of your comment the op has reached a moral crisis because he understands that zionism the political ideology underpinning the state is the root of the problem a zionist pro palestinian organization is a fundamental contradiction that s like telling someone who just realized the injustice of segregation to join a pro equality chapter of the kkk it completely misses the entire point of his post', 'the palestinians are a sick society who only want to murder jews and kick them out of this region you are blind if you don t see it under those hospitals there are hamas headquarters and tons of military equipment but israel shouldn t do anything because there are civilians let s say i m hiding tons of weapons in my basement and everyday i m going to say that i would unleash it at my neighbor what is my neighbor supposed to do by your logic nothing you probably would say something like it it didn t start on so here is my response in the s jews predominantly ashkenazi began purchasing land and properties across the region they didn t come to a land owned by palestinians and kick them out of their home like how you guys are saying arabs and jews lived under the ottoman empire but there was no such thing as a palestinians state your logic is more like if a mexican immigrants would kick americans our of their homes and take it out by force and establish another mexican state did you hear about palestine riots there was no jewish state no occupation whatsoever back then it was civil war under a different regime united nations partition plan for palestine the jews agreed the arabs refuse you would probably say something like the plan was in favor of the jewish people of the population was arab and were jews therefore the arabs rejected it unfortunately it wasn t something like we want more land let s negotiate or something it was more like let s kick all the jews in the region back to the sea they wanted to kick all of the jews from this area they didn t want any partition plan well that is the problem you don t understand the palestinians are the only people in the world where consequences of their actions don t matter the only people in the world with such luxury no consequences for their actions always blame the jews after the partition offer failed because the arab s plan of kicking the jewish people to the sea failed the israeli state was born what happened in was a part of the war the arabs started but there are no consequences for their actions whatsoever they wanted to kick the jews out of the land back then not because they were under a jewish occupation but because the jews were a problem for their ambitions of a muslim caliphate state did you know when the plo palestine liberation organization was founded israel didn t control the west bank and didn t control gaza back then their motive was simple kick the jews out of the land that is the only thing the palestinians had in common hating and wanting to kick the jews back to poland where they came from a nation of people was born out of a full hatred for another group of people their society was based on clans the only thing in common was hatred of jews and israel and even when israel offered the palestinians a state they reject it they reject anything israel even gave the palestinians the gaza strip completely and what they got in return rockets terror and war']"

ve explained this for you several times one more go i m happy to help here s the wording from the rulings that is most relevant in light of the considerations set out above the court considers that there is urgency in the sense that there is a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice to the right to not be a victim of genocide will be caused to the rights found by the court to be plausible before it gives its final decision paragraph of the original january order and again in the updated order in light of the considerations set out above and taking account of the provisional measures indicated on january the court finds that the current situation before it entails a further risk of irreparable prejudice to the plausible rights claimed by south africa and that there is urgency in the sense that there exists a real and imminent risk that such prejudice to the right to not be a victim of genocide will be caused before the court gives its final decision in the case paragraph of march order it s not some abstract ruling it s based on evidence obviously it s an interim ruling hence why the word plausible is used israel may have a defence if the court didn t believe that israels actions were not plausibly causing genocide they would have thrown out the case it was in their power to do so the rights can only plausibly be at risk under the genocide convention if israel is plausibly committing a genocide that s the normal logic as already noted joan donoghue is a us judge previously worked at the us state department israels closest ally so the fact it s onlythe us judge and none of the other should speak volumes that line she said was simply a lie you don t need to believe a lie just because it suits your narrative always look to see how

power and direct territorial authority so their jurisdiction is limited to the extent that countries allow them to the court recalls that it has jurisdiction in respect of states only to the extent that they have consented thereto when a compromissory clause in a treaty provides for the court s jurisdiction that jurisdiction exists only in respect of the parties to the treaty who are bound by that clause and within the limits set out in the clause when uae signed the convention they put reservations on article ix both sudan and the uae are parties to the genocide convention sudan having acceded to the convention on october and the uae on november the uae when acceding to the convention formulated a reservation to article ix which reads as follows the government of the state of the united arab emirates having considered the aforementioned convention and approved the contents thereof formally declares its accession to the convention and makes a reservation with respect to article thereof concerning the submission of disputes arising between the contracting parties relating to the interpretation application or fulfilment of this convention to the international court of justice at the request of any of the parties to the dispute they concluded that those reservation helds and as sudan strongly based the raised issue on article ix the court says that it can not hold jurisdiction on the case and dismissed it the court thus considers that the uae s reservation has the effect of excluding article ix from the provisions of the genocide convention in force between the parties the court concludes from the foregoing that having regard to the uae s reservation to article ix of the genocide convention this article cannot constitute prima facie a basis for the jurisdiction of the court in the present case it follows that the court lacking prima facie jurisdiction to entertain sudan s application cannot indicate the provisional measures requested in order to protect the rights invoked in the application submitted by sudan the court further considers that in light of the reservation made by the uae to the compromissory clause contained in article ix of the genocide convention and in the absence of any other basis of jurisdiction the court manifestly lacks jurisdiction to entertain sudan s application but it notes having come to the conclusion that it manifestly lacks jurisdiction the court is precluded by its statute from taking any position on the merits of the claims made by sudan however as the court has stated on numerous previous occasions there is a fundamental distinction between the question of acceptance by the states of the court s jurisdiction and the conformity of their acts with international law whether or not states have accepted the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to article ix of the genocide convention they are required to comply with their obligations under that instrument and they remain responsible for acts attributable to them which are contrary to their international obligations source so we have an actual genocide being ignored in sudan while a war to remove an internationally recognized terrorist organization is legally entertained as a genocide and publicly touted as such']"

we mean by intelligence but we often get derailed before reaching that discussion frequently denying basic genetic principles in order to preserve a perfectly anti eugenics posture the result is a

trait can be heritable if you can define it and trace it to a set of interacting genes that s the part that scares people but the fact that the mere act of procreation can turn that supposed moral

anthropologist race is a societal structure based on phenotypic traits because arab jews and muslim arabs stem from the same gene pool they exhibit similar traits ur gonna tell me that a fucking syrian jew is not gonna be labeled as arab with brown skin dark curly hair and phenotypic traits common in the middle east jews are an ethnoreligion because of their gene variation and isolation due to their very specific diaspora ashkenazi can also make the case for being a race and ethnic group since they all descended from people post dark ages they have traits more commonly presented due to their limit of outside genes over centuries this also led to an increase in genetic disorders found disproportionately more amongst ashkenazi jews specifally race is literally how you look and how the general public will perceive you call them what you want but if they re brown they will be labeled as so in america people are stupid hence why indians in turbans were getting beat up after while all

been extensively studied over the last years and their origins are nearing full resolution ashkenazi jews are remarkably genetically homogeneous due to a genetic bottleneck in the middle ages ashkenazi jews are a mixture of levantine middle eastern and european ancestries it is beyond any reasonable doubt from autosomal and ydna evidence that ashkenazi jews have significant middle eastern genealogical descent and ancestry which is manifested in genetic markers which are close to lebanese syrian druze palestinian kurdish and other middle eastern groups ashkenazi jews have considerable shared ancestry with other jewish groups including sephardic and mizrachi jews which predates the jewish diaspora the most recent autosomal estimates of ashkenazi ancestry from full genome sequencing and using modern refernce populations from the near east and europe indicate they are approximately middle eastern and european some recent autosomal analyses such as xue et al indicate that ashkenazi jewish european ancestry is predominantly southern european with a smaller degree of eastern european admixture groundbreaking research still in abstract form and not released in full by shai carmi et al on ancient caananite dna sequenced from bone fragments at archaeological sites in israel which serves as a better proxy for ancient near eastern populations than modern levantine populations who were likely impacted by the arabic expansion and other admixture events indicate ashkenazi jews can trace approximately of their ancestry to the ancient near east more than of ashkenazi patrilineal ydna clades are from the near east indicating strong direct middle eastern patrilineal ancestry the maternal ancestry from mtdna clades of ashkenazi jews is debated by the scientific community and there is not a firm consensus as to whether they are predominantly from the near east as put forward by karl skorecki and doron behar or from europe as put forward by marta d costa the genetic

it being an ethnostate our being an ethnostate has caused massive issues in the past ethnostates are fucking horrible and all the issues being caused by israel right now are especially worse because they re trying to establish an ethnostate on land to which another people are native', 'israel is an ethnostate because it legally codifies the state as explicitly preferential for a specific ethnoreligious demographic and actively tries to keep that demogrpahic in majority so that they maintain control of their beauracratic structure more simply the nation state law of israel quite literally says the right to exercise national self determination in the state of israel is unique to the jewish people not to israelis to jewish people despite the fact that there are many non jewish israelis it then uses the right of return law to explicitly preference jews and ensure that there s a constant influx for them to maintain demographic majority so a lot of people at this point will saying something like but the nonjews have fully equal rights except they don t since they are being denied the right to self determination sure they on an individual basis can be voted into parliament but operationally the interests of the arab demographic cannot ever be truly respresented because the state is actively taking measures to suppress them let s say that jews suddenly stop wanting to immigrate to israel over the course of several decades through birth rate changes muslims and christians are now outnumbering jews converting en masse to become followers of ronald mcdonald and intend at the next election to vote in the mcdonalds party who will change the nation state law to say the right to self determination is unique to mcdonalds customers now the incumbent government is constitutionally obligated to maintain the jewish majority and jewish power structure and with no jews coming in the only result is non jews must in one way or another cease to be a factor the problem is that israel is a state for jews rather than a state for israelis there are israelis in israel that are being suppressed this is a big part of the reason why israel refuses to acknowledge palestinian statehood and insists on controlling its affairs if palestinian territories were absorbed into israel and palestinians became israeli citizens then jews would be in the minority israel is an ethnostate because it is specifically trying to keep these people in power on an ethnoreligious basis', 'that is the pettiest technicallity i ve seen to try to diverge attention from the ethnostate law but sure here i go israel is not an ethnostate because it has a jewish majority israel is an ethnostate because the jewish majority decided to enshrine in their basic law akin to a constitution and interpreted as such in the supreme court that israel is the nation state of the jews and the the right of self determination is exclusive to the jewish people only problem is that one in every four israelis are not jewish it would be like the uk the uk is white by the way they have a higher proportion of whites than israel has of jews saying that the uk is the nation of the white race and that the right of self determination is exclusive to the white race everyone and their mothers would recognize that as far right facist ethnonationalism folk like you point to other countries with a higher proportion of a single ethnicity and shout that they are examples of ethnostates you people point a lot to japan when doing that and japan s constitution indeed talk about serving the japanese people but that same constitution defines japanese people solely by nationality in other words nationalized japanese citzens are part of the japanese people different from japan nationalized arab israelis are not jewish it is not my fault that you live in a country that decided to enshrine in its basic law akin to a constitution and interpreted as such in the supreme court such medieval and antiquated racist policy especially considering that these of non jewish israelis that the country have aren t even immigrants they were there since the formation of the state so just to make it clear as day you live in a ethnostate because of your population is not jewish your basic law akin to a constitution and interpreted as such in the supreme court states that you are a jewish country and that self determination is exclusive to the jews if you behaved like any modern country and replaced jewish with israeli i could even defend you if you decided that every arab and palestinian living in israel is also jewish than you would also not be an ethnostate but of course you don t want to do that because you enjoy living in a jewish ethnostate']"

that can mean anything and even richard medhurst calls himself that he s as biased as they come my comment should have been uncontroversial because it wasn t about the conflict as such it was just a simple statement like this while legitimate criticism of israeli government policies is not antisemitism jewish students are not the israeli government so harassing jewish students and blaming them for israel s actions is of course antisemitism one response denied it was even happening and asked for proof one response played oppression olympics and said what s happening in gaza is worse so therefore jewish students should be grateful they re only being harassed and not bombed that s a horrendous reply and clearly imposes some sort of collective guilt on jewish students we would not accept this rhetoric aimed at muslim students after isis commits a terrorist attack but for some reason people think it s ok with diaspora jews it is not but it s been normalised too much recently as if people have pushed the envelope as far as possible to test the limits of this sort of language pushback is badly needed one response basically used token asajews and said since jews are in the protests it can t be antisemitism those people seem to think it can only be antisemitism if of jews are offended by it the comment section was atrocious even apart from that people just do not want to believe antisemitic harassment of jewish students is happening and if they do they don t care or even victim blame jews or even accuse them of distracting people from genocide tm on behalf of the israeli government and that s without getting into all the misuse of the words zionism and zionist most zionists are american christians so when they say zionists bombed this hospital or similar it s a dogwhistle for israelis and it s usually israeli jews they re thinking of they know most zionists are christian and say so to deflect antisemitism allegations but they never seem to target christian zionists with their vitriol and when they say zionists in almost any other context you can tell they re thinking of israeli jews yet again one person even listed every jewish member of the us congress

discussing the war it s discussing if jewish people are a people or if they are considered human beings our president issued a statement outlining the events a day after oct th giving his condolences to both the jewish community and all people affected including palestinians in the student bds referendum months later the muslim student association said that this actively harmed palestinian

persecution fetish is giving off vibes like this lol columbia university has descended into chaos not really students have peacefully demonstrated outside by doing sit ins and encampments the only thing resembling chaos here were columbia students getting suspended expelled and subsequently getting arrested for trespassing on their campus after the president of the university called the cops on them this seems to be the case as ilhan omar s daughter who attended columbia was also arrested on those charges for protesting on campus after being suspended it s a dirty trick and one you left out of your post in order to paint the protestors as criminals given that columbia university is a private university and anti israel protests frequently turn violent not really i m sure you can cherry pick a few instances of violence at these protests while removing the context behind them like the alleged instances of violence mentioned in the article but this encampment seems to be a broadly peaceful movement uh huh telling jews to go back to poland is not free inquiry rioting vandalism trespassing and limiting the movement of others are not considered free speech instead of giving some nuance to the protestors you lump them all in as violators of the law who are not innocently expressing their right to free speech but are in your imagination targeting jews specifically and harassing them based on their ethnic background go back to poland a mob surrounding jews and calling them genocidal freaks it is right to rebel hamas give them hell settlers settlers go back home palestine is ours alone al qasam s next targets now look through those links and try thinking about whether or not maybe there is more to the story than the evil protestors harassing innocent jews because of their ethnic background when jewish students are holding seder at the encampment funny is that if you at least showed an ounce of this sorrow for people being murdered or when the jewish voice for peace and students for justice in palestine were banned by columbia or when columbia students were sprayed by former idf soldiers with a chemical substance i would be taking your concerns about slogans praising al qassam more seriously though it doesn t even look like that was at columbia but definitely in nyc frankly i am skeptical of the claims and videos used to demonize the protestors not just because they ignore the overwhelming majority of protestors but things like the woman talking about al qassam s next targets could quite easily be a character in a pro israeli demonstration trying to get their point across see it should go without saying that this jews apparently do not count as a minority who are targets of hateful ideology it s ok to break the law against objectionable speakers the protestors in both cases are believed to be fighting back against bigotry the only times that columbia professors and students as well as academia in general care about free speech is when it s used to bash israel and conservatives there is a distinction between inviting a speaker to campus who will follow the law and harassment if the speaker s views are objectionable most of all columbia
